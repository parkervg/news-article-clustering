# newsfeed-nlp

## Abstract 
This unsupervised learning project allows the average news consumer to experience a stream-lined information acquisition process, free of any useless repetition. Working in Python and using a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news) of 85,000 news articles, we extract significance from the texts by utilizing a modified TFIDF-vectorizer to pre-process the data. We experiment with various clustering techniques (Kmeans, HAC, and KNN), paired with various success metrics to gauge effectiveness of the news consolidation. Visualizations are created using Seaborn and Matplotlib, along with D3 for ease of exploration. Spacy is used as the primary NLP.

## Motivation
In a political climate of intensely polarizing takes on the latest scandals, international relations, and national issues, it can be difficult to make sense of all the data. With the rise of social media, the ability to publish has been democratized and repetition in the newsfeed runs rampant. By grouping together news stories by topic, not only is the newsfeed browsing process streamlined, but groups created that provide differing perspective on the same story.

| 0  | 17283 | House Republicans Fret About Winning Their Health Care Suit - The New York Times               | New York Times | Carl Hulse                     | 12/31/16 | 2016  | 12  |         | WASHINGTON  ‚Äî   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administration‚Äôs authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. Trump‚Äôs administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. ‚ÄúGiven that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment,‚Äù said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. ‚ÄúUpon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. ‚Äù In a potentially   decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge Collyer‚Äôs decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they ‚Äúand the  ‚Äôs transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the  ‚Äôs inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. ‚Äù The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will ‚Äúprovide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. ‚Äù Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of ‚Äúcascading effects‚Äù if the   payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  ‚Äôs dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case ‚Äúwill produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nation‚Äôs health insurance and health care systems generally. ‚Äù No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required  ‚Äî   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  ‚Äî   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  ‚Äî   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.

| 1  | 17284 | Rift Between Officers and Residents as Killings Persist in South Bronx - The New York Times    | New York Times | Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker  | 6/19/17  | 2017  | 6   |         | After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the city‚Äôs efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the city‚Äôs 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the city‚Äôs five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The borough‚Äôs robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan‚Äôs, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In   lobbies and   family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors, more fearful of a gunman‚Äôs crew than confident in the Police Department‚Äôs ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller‚Äôs arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. ‚ÄúHere, we have nothing,‚Äù she said. When it comes to ‚Äú  families,‚Äù she said, the authorities ‚Äúdon‚Äôt really care as much. That‚Äôs how I feel. ‚Äù The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City. The homicides  ‚Äî   14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015  ‚Äî   strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers‚Äô view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives‚Äô phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victim‚Äôs friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother‚Äôs apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews‚Äô threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Mary‚Äôs Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you,‚Äù a sergeant‚Äôs police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to shoot through your window. ‚Äù Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers‚Äô names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same    propped his bike on their door, ‚Äúthen said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me,‚Äù Mr. Fernandez‚Äôs wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to ‚Äúslap‚Äù her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because ‚Äúthey are the ones snitching,‚Äù her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precinct‚Äôs residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk  ‚Äî   dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves  ‚Äî   bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the city‚Äôs   campaign. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt got one single phone call that‚Äôs putting me in the right direction here,‚Äù said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precinct‚Äôs detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim‚Äôs aunt about why the killer had not been caught. ‚ÄúAnd people just don‚Äôt understand that. ‚Äù Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third  ‚Äî   66 victims  ‚Äî   refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics, like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the    strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the   stops in the city, the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. ‚ÄúI need to bring something in today to justify my existence,‚Äù Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. ‚ÄúSo now you‚Äôre in a small area, and day after day you‚Äôre hammering the same community. Of course that community‚Äôs eventually going to turn on you. ‚Äù The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. ‚ÄúSome of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too,‚Äù said Hector Espada, a   veteran of the precinct. ‚ÄúNot because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you can‚Äôt give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. ‚Äù Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be ‚Äúticket fixing,‚Äù or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like   that put them in   situations on the street. ‚ÄúWhenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud,‚Äù said Russell Lewis, a    of the 40th. ‚ÄúIt was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didn‚Äôt want to get caught up in anything. ‚Äù The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift  ‚Äî   a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. O‚ÄôNeill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. O‚ÄôNeill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to people‚Äôs concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. ‚ÄúThat perception really sticks,‚Äù he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinct‚Äôs 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    ‚Äî   murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino, the head of the Detectives‚Äô Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the department‚Äôs efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: ‚ÄúIf I cooperate with the detectives, there‚Äôs so much work, there‚Äôs so few of them there, they won‚Äôt even get the chance to protect me, or they‚Äôll be there too late when the retaliation comes. ‚Äù Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. ‚ÄúWe fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had,‚Äù he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The Times‚Äôs analysis of confidential staffing data, the department‚Äôs chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinct‚Äôs detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city‚Äôs last ‚Äú‚Äù the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. ‚ÄúAny crime in Manhattan has to be solved,‚Äù said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. ‚ÄúThe outer boroughs are, like, forgotten. ‚Äù Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last year‚Äôs homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan,‚Äù said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part ‚Äúbecause that‚Äôs where the money is. ‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWhen de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then he‚Äôs done the complete opposite of what he said. It‚Äôs just business as usual. ‚Äù The Bronx‚Äôs struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyn‚Äôs rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice O‚ÄôShaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney‚Äôs office. The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, ‚ÄúI was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they can‚Äôt be impartial because they don‚Äôt trust the police. ‚Äù Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzo‚Äôs detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son‚Äôs ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precinct‚Äôs homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist‚Äôs help. Victims‚Äô families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy   squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would ‚Äúget what you deserve. ‚Äù The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a woman‚Äôs son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name  ‚Äî   about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  ‚Äî   and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisor‚Äôs permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandez‚Äôs daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victim‚Äôs advocate in the district attorney‚Äôs office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissioner‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúWe went to all proper channels for help,‚Äù the note said. ‚ÄúBoth precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. ‚Äù ‚Äú40th and PSA 7 won‚Äôt do anything,‚Äù he wrote, referring to the local substation. ‚ÄúPlease we need to speak to some one with authority. ‚Äù The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector Jerry O‚ÄôSullivan, and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a woman‚Äôs apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. ‚ÄúI have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians,‚Äù Mr. Fernandez said. ‚ÄúThe only thing I know for sure: God, if we‚Äôre in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family. ‚Äù Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bending over backward, and nobody‚Äôs not even doing anything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhy am I going to help you, if you ain‚Äôt going to help me?‚Äù By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector O‚ÄôSullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. ‚ÄúNo one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment,‚Äù he said. Mr. Fernandez‚Äôs complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away. | 
| 2  | 17285 | Tyrus Wong, ‚ÄòBambi‚Äô Artist Thwarted by Racial Bias, Dies at 106 - The New York Times       | New York Times | Margalit Fox                   | 1/6/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | When Walt Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúBambi‚Äù opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the film‚Äôs striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to ‚ÄúBambi,‚Äù which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the film‚Äôs title character, the artist, Tyrus Wong, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  ‚Äî   and, in the hope of making a life in America, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  ‚Äî   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso, Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios, among them ‚ÄúThe Sands of Iwo Jima‚Äù (1949) ‚ÄúRebel Without a Cause‚Äù (1955) and ‚ÄúThe Wild Bunch‚Äù (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for ‚ÄúBambi‚Äù that Mr. Wong was  ‚Äî   belatedly  ‚Äî   most renowned. ‚ÄúHe was truly involved with every phase of production,‚Äù John Canemaker, an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University, said in an interview for this obituary in March. ‚ÄúHe created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. ‚Äù In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Wong was the subject of ‚ÄúWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,‚Äù a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museum‚Äôs windows, which overlook San Francisco Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States, leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  ‚Äî   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a ‚Äúpaper son‚Äù  ‚Äî   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  ‚Äî   or, in the case of Gen Yeo and his father, ‚Äúpaper sons‚Äù posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. ‚ÄúAngel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,‚Äù Lisa See, the author of ‚ÄúOn Gold Mountain‚Äù (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: ‚ÄúThe goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. ‚Äù Because Mr. Wong‚Äôs father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. ‚ÄúI was scared half to death I just cried,‚Äù Mr. Wong recalled in ‚ÄúTyrus,‚Äù an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015. ‚ÄúEvery day is just miserable  ‚Äî   miserable. I hated that place. ‚Äù On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young Gen Yeo, posing as Look Tai Yow, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher Americanized ‚ÄúTai Yow‚Äù to ‚ÄúTyrus,‚Äù and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  ‚Äî   possibly more  ‚Äî   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  ‚Äî   a small fortune  ‚Äî   to let him stay on as Otis‚Äôs youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental Artists‚Äô Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of members‚Äô work  ‚Äî   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong, newly married and needing steady work, joined Disney in 1938 as an ‚Äú‚Äù creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios, and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact, first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  ‚Äôs job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  ‚Äî   ‚Äúa terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,‚Äù Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting ‚ÄúBambi, a Life in the Woods,‚Äù the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film ‚ÄúSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,‚Äù a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  ‚Äî   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  ‚Äî   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for ‚ÄúBambi,‚Äù it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòGee, this is all outdoor scenery,‚Äô‚Äù he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòGee, I‚Äôm a landscape painter! ‚Äô‚Äù Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 ‚Äî  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  ‚Äî   at once lush and spare  ‚Äî   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. ‚ÄúWalt Disney went crazy over them,‚Äù said Mr. Canemaker, who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book ‚ÄúBefore the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists‚Äù (1996). ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. ‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. ‚ÄúBut he was more than that,‚Äù Mr. Canemaker explained. ‚ÄúHe was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. ‚Äù Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of ‚ÄúBambi. ‚Äù Throughout the finished film  ‚Äî   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  ‚Äî   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employees‚Äô strike that year, Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  ‚Äî   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  ‚Äî   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On ‚ÄúBambi,‚Äù Mr. Wong‚Äôs name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere ‚Äúbackground‚Äù artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942, working there  ‚Äî   and lent out on occasion to other studios  ‚Äî   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former Ruth Kim, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. ‚ÄúThen in a month you‚Äôd go back there and the sign was still there,‚Äù Mr. Wong recalled in ‚ÄúTyrus. ‚Äù After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental Artists‚Äô Group. Mr. Wong‚Äôs friend Mr. Okubo was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. ‚ÄúIf World War II hadn‚Äôt happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,‚Äù Ms. See said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. ‚Äù Mr. Wong, who became a United States citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland, Calif. he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  ‚Äî   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  ‚Äî   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth Wong‚Äôs life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on ‚ÄúBambi,‚Äù Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  ‚Äî   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray, Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  ‚Äî   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family Museum‚Äôs retrospective, ‚ÄúWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,‚Äù traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America, in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Wong‚Äôs death, at his home in Sunland, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters, Kay Fong,   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.

| 3  | 17286 | Among Deaths in 2016, a Heavy Toll in Pop Music - The New York Times                           | New York Times | William McDonald               | 4/10/17  | 2017  | 4   |         | Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn‚Äôt necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  ‚Äî   consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the      Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds  ‚Äî   the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona  ‚Äî   androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist  ‚Äî   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  ‚Äî   I hesitate to say merry  ‚Äî   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, ‚ÄúUntil then, here‚Äôs another song. ‚Äù It was as if 2016 hadn‚Äôt delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can‚Äôt bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth, Wind  Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man‚Äôs mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis‚Äôs swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf‚Äôs first media star. The gentleman‚Äôs game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  ‚Äî   but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor‚Äôs son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  ‚Äî   his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant  ‚Äî   can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women‚Äôs basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a   Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball‚Äôs first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan‚Äôs death evoked the 1980s White House, where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn‚Äôs had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War‚Äôs roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly‚Äôs obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing‚Äôs ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Eli√°n Gonz√°lez, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro‚Äôs death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros   the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are   even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and,   Edward Albee  ‚Äî   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  ‚Äî   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the     Princess Leia of the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother‚Äôs grief. Devotees of the ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape‚Äôs younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor‚Äôs celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù movies and ‚ÄúBarney Miller,‚Äù actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his   meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics‚Äô eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (‚ÄúAdventures of Superman‚Äù) Alan Young (‚ÄúMister Ed‚Äù) Robert Vaughn (‚ÄúThe Man From U. N. C. L. E. ‚Äù) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on ‚ÄúThe Patty Duke Show‚Äù) Dan Haggerty (‚ÄúThe Life and Times of Grizzly Adams‚Äù) Florence Henderson (‚ÄúThe Brady Bunch‚Äù) and Alan Thicke (‚ÄúGrowing Pains‚Äù). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with ‚ÄúHappy Days,‚Äù ‚ÄúMork  Mindy,‚Äù ‚ÄúLaverne  Shirley‚Äù and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker‚Äôs jacket with a camera slung around his neck  ‚Äî   what a picture!  ‚Äî   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music‚Äôs other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a   executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ‚Äô80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone‚Äôs guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.

| 4  | 17287 | Kim Jong-un Says North Korea Is Preparing to Test Long-Range Missile - The New York Times      | New York Times | Choe Sang-Hun                  | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | SEOUL, South Korea  ‚Äî   North Korea‚Äôs leader, Kim   said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  ‚Äî   a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump. Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never   an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New Year‚Äôs Day speech, which was broadcast on the North‚Äôs   KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea. ‚ÄúWe have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,‚Äù he said. Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea. Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. In South Korea, President Park   whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated. If North Korea conducts a    test in coming months, it will test Mr. Trump‚Äôs new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim‚Äôs professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Mr. Kim‚Äôs speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong   a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Mr. Cheong said. ‚ÄúWe need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year‚Äôs speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,‚Äù he said. In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump‚Äôs election. Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the North‚Äôs launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the North‚Äôs satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds  ‚Äî   far enough to reach most of the United States. North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan, its   ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere without breaking up. In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time, Mr. Kim said the North ‚Äúcan tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range. ‚Äù On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test. Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North.

| 5  | 17288 | Sick With a Cold, Queen Elizabeth Misses New Year‚Äôs Service - The New York Times             | New York Times | Sewell Chan                    | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | LONDON  ‚Äî   Queen Elizabeth II, who has been battling a cold for more than a week, missed a New Year‚Äôs Day church service at her country estate in Sandringham, Buckingham Palace said on Sunday. A week earlier, the queen, who is 90, missed a Christmas Day church service, for the first time since 1988, because of the illness. ‚ÄúThe Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold,‚Äù the palace said in a statement. The queen‚Äôs husband, Prince Philip, who had also been ill, was well enough to attend both services, in the church at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, on the east coast of England. The queen, who ascended to the throne in 1952, became the world‚Äôs   monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October. She is also Britain‚Äôs   monarch, having last year surpassed Queen Victoria‚Äôs   reign. Her mother lived until the age of 101.

| 6  | 17289 | Taiwan‚Äôs President Accuses China of Renewed Intimidation - The New York Times                | New York Times | Javier C. Hern√°ndez           | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | BEIJING  ‚Äî   President Tsai   of Taiwan sharply criticized China‚Äôs leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island. ‚ÄúStep by step, Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan,‚Äù she told journalists in Taipei, the capital, at a   news conference. Tensions between Taiwan and China, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks, China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, Beijing announced that S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan‚Äôs fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in Taiwan. Despite Beijing‚Äôs recent actions, which she said had ‚Äúhurt the feelings‚Äù of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. ‚ÄúWe will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,‚Äù she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States, which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The   has also questioned the One China policy, which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades, and criticized China‚Äôs military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Ms. Tsai‚Äôs words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of China‚Äôs show of strength. ‚ÄúShe remains calm, rational and patient,‚Äù Ms. Glaser wrote in an email. Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, could face serious challenges in the coming months. Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. Trump will use the island as a bargaining chip against China. And Ms. Tsai‚Äôs preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. Trump‚Äôs bombastic style. Richard C. Bush, the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Ms. Tsai understood the need to ‚Äúmaintain a balance among relations with China, relations with the United States and domestic politics. ‚Äù Ms. Tsai‚Äôs vision, however, ‚Äúmay not align well with the incoming Trump administration‚Äôs apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,‚Äù he said. Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country, warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan. Ms. Tsai described the visit as ‚Äúunofficial,‚Äù saying, ‚ÄúA transit stop is just a transit stop. ‚Äù

| 7  | 17290 | After ‚ÄòThe Biggest Loser,‚Äô Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight - The New York Times       | New York Times | Gina Kolata                    | 2/8/17   | 2017  | 2   |         | Danny Cahill stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage. He had won Season 8 of NBC‚Äôs reality television show ‚ÄúThe Biggest Loser,‚Äù shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program  ‚Äî   an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months. When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec. 8, 2009, he weighed just 191 pounds, down from 430. Dressed in a   and   shorts, he was lean, athletic and as handsome as a model. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my life back,‚Äù he declared. ‚ÄúI mean, I feel like a million bucks. ‚Äù Mr. Cahill left the show‚Äôs stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with Jay Leno, Regis Philbin and Joy Behar. As he heard from fans all over the world, his elation knew no bounds. But in the years since, more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his    frame despite his best efforts. In fact, most of that season‚Äôs 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously. Some are even heavier now. Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science. A study of Season 8‚Äôs contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose. Kevin Hall, a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV, had the idea to follow the ‚ÄúBiggest Loser‚Äù contestants for six years after that victorious night. The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise. The results, the researchers said, were stunning. They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss. ‚ÄúIt is frightening and amazing,‚Äù said Dr. Hall, an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. ‚ÄúI am just blown away. ‚Äù It has to do with resting metabolism, which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began, the contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes. Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight  ‚Äî   even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight  ‚Äî   will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not surprised to see that ‚ÄúThe Biggest Loser‚Äù contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended. What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants‚Äô metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight. Mr. Cahill was one of the worst off. As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size. Anything more turns to fat. The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nation‚Äôs obesity problem, which afflicts more than a third of American adults. Despite spending billions of dollars on   drugs and dieting programs, even the most motivated are working against their own biology. Their experience shows that the body will fight back for years. And that, said Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, is ‚Äúnew and important. ‚Äù ‚ÄúThe key point is that you can be on TV, you can lose enormous amounts of weight, you can go on for six years, but you can‚Äôt get away from a basic biological reality,‚Äù said Dr. Schwartz, who was not involved in the study. ‚ÄúAs long as you are below your initial weight, your body is going to try to get you back. ‚Äù The show‚Äôs doctor, Robert Huizenga, says he expected the contestants‚Äô metabolic rates to fall just after the show, but was hoping for a smaller drop. He questioned, though, whether the measurements six years later were accurate. But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors, psychologists, sleep specialists, and trainers  ‚Äî   and that‚Äôs something we all need to work hard to change,‚Äù he said in an email. The study‚Äôs findings, to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity. Researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions, and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat. They are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails. And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people. The hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life. Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back. But what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies, which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights, whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off. There is always a weight a person‚Äôs body maintains without any effort. And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  ‚Äî   it may be an effect of aging  ‚Äî   at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend. Finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for. First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail. Dr. David Ludwig, the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, who was not involved in the research, said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control. He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight. But, he added, the findings made sense. ‚ÄúThis is a subset of the most successful‚Äù dieters, he said. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?‚Äù Still, he added, ‚Äúthat shouldn‚Äôt be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat. It means we need to explore other approaches. ‚Äù Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss. Only when that challenge is solved, they say, can progress truly be made against obesity. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of basic research we still need to do,‚Äù said Dr. Margaret Jackson, who is directing a project at Pfizer. Her group is testing a drug that, in animals at least, acts like leptin, a hormone that controls hunger. With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry. The idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin. While many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active, the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them: Erinn Egbert, a   caregiver for her mother in Versailles, Ky. And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size. ‚ÄúWhat people don‚Äôt understand is that a treat is like a drug,‚Äù said Ms. Egbert, who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show, and now weighs between 152 and 157. ‚ÄúTwo treats can turn into a binge over a   period. That is what I struggle with. ‚Äù Six years after Season 8 ended, 14 of the 16 contestants went to the N. I. H. last fall for three days of testing. The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to the N. I. H. The contestants received their metabolic results last week. They were shocked, but on further reflection, decided the numbers explained a lot. ‚ÄúAll my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight,‚Äù Mr. Cahill said. ‚ÄúThe moment I started drinking beer, there goes another 20 pounds. I said, ‚ÄòThis is not right. Something is wrong with my body. ‚Äô‚Äù Sean Algaier, 36, a pastor from Charlotte, N. C. feels cheated. He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show. Now his weight is up to 450 again, and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like hearing you have a life sentence,‚Äù he said. Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight, though. They constantly battled hunger, cravings and binges. The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin. The contestants started out with normal levels of leptin. By the season‚Äôs finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time. As their weight returned, their leptin levels drifted up again, but only to about half of what they had been when the season began, the researchers found, thus helping to explain their urges to eat. Leptin is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger, and although Dr. Hall and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them, another group of researchers, in a different project, did. In a   study funded by Australia‚Äôs National Health and Medical Research Council, Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks. They lost an average of nearly 30 pounds, but over the next year, the pounds started coming back. Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people. Levels of most of them fell in their study subjects. They also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat. Its level rose. ‚ÄúWhat was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is,‚Äù Dr. Proietto said. ‚ÄúThe body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight. The only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time. We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with   use. ‚Äù Mr. Cahill, 46, said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade. He got fat, then fatter. He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon. Afterward, he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with shame. Over the years, his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him, and his weight climbed: 370 pounds, 400, 460, 485. ‚ÄúI used to look at myself and think, ‚ÄòI am horrible, I am a monster, subhuman,‚Äô‚Äù he said. He began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down. Walking hurt stairs were agony. Buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating. ‚ÄúI remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit. I looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought, ‚ÄòI should just run out in front of a car. ‚Äô‚Äù He eventually seized on ‚ÄúThe Biggest Loser‚Äù as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life. He tried three times and was finally selected. Before the show began, the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead. And rigorous it was. Sequestered on the ‚ÄúBiggest Loser‚Äù ranch with the other contestants, Mr. Cahill exercised seven hours a day, burning 8, 000 to 9, 000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him. He took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating, consuming many fewer calories than before. Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own. Mr. Cahill set a goal of a   deficit per day. The idea was to lose a pound a day. He quit his job as a land surveyor to do it. His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a. m. and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes. Have breakfast  ‚Äî   typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast. Run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym. Work out for two and a half hours. Shower, ride home, eat lunch  ‚Äî   typically a grilled skinless chicken breast, a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus. Rest for an hour. Drive to the gym for another round of exercise. If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more. At times, he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his   indicator reset to zero at midnight. On the day of the   on the show‚Äôs finale, Mr. Cahill and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained, to their surprise and horror, after they had lost weight. They wore compression undergarments to hold it in. Mr. Cahill knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds. He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended. But he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever, and for the next four years, he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day. But two years ago, he went back to his job as a surveyor, and the pounds started coming back. Soon the scale hit 265. Mr. Cahill started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise. He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds. But his weight edged up again, to 275, then 295. His slow metabolism is part of the problem, and so are his food cravings. He opens a bag of chips, thinking he will have just a few. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd eat five bites. Then I‚Äôd black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, ‚ÄòWhat did I do? ‚Äô‚Äù Dr. Lee Kaplan, an obesity researcher at Harvard, says the brain sets the number of calories we consume, and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories. Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies, said the body‚Äôs systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss. Still, pounds can insidiously creep on. ‚ÄúWe eat about 900, 000 to a million calories a year, and burn them all except those annoying 3, 000 to 5, 000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  ‚Äî   less than one Starburst candy  ‚Äî   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating. ‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle, the environment or just the biology of aging,‚Äù Dr. Rosenbaum added. The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight, Dr. Hall said. Yes, there are signals to regain weight, but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat. He found a way to figure that out. He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo. The drug has no known effect on the brain, and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled. Those taking the drug gradually lost weight. But for every five pounds they lost, they were, without realizing it, eating an additional 200 calories a day. Those extra calories, Dr. Hall said, were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism. And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry. ‚ÄúUnless they continue to fight it constantly, they will regain the weight,‚Äù he said. All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say. Individuals respond differently to diet manipulations  ‚Äî     or   diets, for example  ‚Äî   and to exercise and   drugs, among other interventions. But Dr. Ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer. ‚ÄúThere are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories,‚Äù he said, but he added that ‚Äúfor most people, the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  ‚Äî   explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months. ‚Äù Dr. Rosenbaum agreed. ‚ÄúThe difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of the U. S. A. ,‚Äù he said. Mr. Cahill knows that now. And with his report from Dr. Hall‚Äôs group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed, he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain. ‚ÄúThat shame that was on my shoulders went off,‚Äù he said.

| 8  | 17291 | First, a Mixtape. Then a Romance. - The New York Times                                         | New York Times | Katherine Rosman               | 12/31/16 | 2016  | 12  |         | Just how   is Hillary Kerr, the    founder of a   digital media company in Los Angeles? She can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband. It was ‚ÄúThese Days,‚Äù the version sung by Nico, the German   made famous by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground. Actually, the song had been playing just before she met Jonathan Leahy, now 38, on that December night in 2011 at the 4100 Bar in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Ms. Kerr can‚Äôt remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down ‚Äúlike Tigger,‚Äù as she put it. In answering the usual     questions, Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for ‚ÄúGirls,‚Äù the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham. That was enough to get Ms. Kerr bouncing. ‚ÄúYour music has changed my life!‚Äù she told Mr. Leahy. Mr. Leahy, who is quiet but not shy (at least he doesn‚Äôt jump up and down upon meeting people) was mesmerized. ‚ÄúMy main reaction,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwas it‚Äôs a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you‚Äôre working on a hit show. ‚Äù They exchanged email addresses, more an act of politeness than promise. Then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year. Both Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr had active social lives, but they were focused on their careers. Mr. Leahy, who grew up in Laconia, N. H. graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. in 2000 and landed in Los Angeles later that year. Now he is a music supervisor with Aperture Music and is joined by Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe in being responsible for the music on ‚ÄúGirls. ‚Äù The team has also worked on films including ‚ÄúTrainwreck‚Äù and television series such as ‚ÄúNew Girl. ‚Äù In addition, Mr. Leahy is the music supervisor for ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äôs Remorse‚Äù on Starz. Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego, graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York, where she took a job as an assistant at Elle magazine. In 2005 she moved back to the West Coast, to Los Angeles, and with a fellow Elle alum,  Katherine Power, created a company best known for its website, Who What Wear, which casts an eye on celebrity culture and fashion it now has 13 million monthly unique visitors. Ms. Kerr and Ms. Power also started the Who What Wear clothing and accessories line sold at Target. It was nine months after their initial meeting that Mr. Leahy emailed Ms. Kerr. He had a friend who wanted to get into the fashion industry. Ms. Kerr, Mr. Leahy and his friend met for a long, boozy brunch. They began to email and text a bit. ‚ÄúThere was banter,‚Äù Ms. Kerr said, but neither knew the interest or intention of the other. A few months later, she texted to ask if he could help her score a ticket to see the band Lord Huron. Mr. Leahy happens to be a friend of Ben Schneider, the band‚Äôs lead singer, and had an extra ticket. ‚ÄúThis was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are,‚Äù Mr. Leahy said. He and Ms. Kerr met up at the show. That is when Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr moved into the ambiguous ‚Äúmixtape era,‚Äù in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy ‚Äúare we just friends or what‚Äù texts revolving around music. For example, Ms. Kerr was visiting New York and texted Mr. Leahy a request for ‚Äúwalking around SoHo music. ‚Äù He sent her a link to ‚ÄúLove Me Again,‚Äù by John Newman. It has a club vibe but romantic lyrics. ‚ÄúI wanted to read into it,‚Äù Ms. Kerr said, but she figured (correctly, it turns out) that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didn‚Äôt spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her. Another time he emailed her a link to a Fleetwood Mac version of ‚ÄúNeed Your Love So Bad. ‚Äù After listening to it, Ms. Kerr said, ‚ÄúI called my friend Katie. ‚Äù ‚ÄúAt that time,‚Äù she continued, ‚ÄúI just referred to him as ‚Äòthe supervisor.‚Äô She knew I had a crush on him. She said, ‚ÄòHow can it not mean something? ‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Leahy acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending Ms. Kerr a message with this song. ‚ÄúI sort of thought, ‚ÄòMaybe it‚Äôs too much. ‚Äô‚Äù But he shared it with her anyway. (This is the same man who sent her the song ‚ÄúBedBedBedBedBed, Vacationer Remix,‚Äù by Deleted Scenes, ‚Äúduring the friend phase,‚Äù Ms. Kerr said.) Ms. Kerr played the game, too. She made Mr. Leahy a mix CD (handwritten liner notes and all) that she titled ‚ÄúFeynman Diagrams for All,‚Äù after Mr. Leahy told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of Feynman diagrams  ‚Äî   in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles  ‚Äî   was romantic. On the mix, Ms. Kerr included the Mazzy Star song ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Let Down. ‚Äù It was ‚Äúa bit of an Easter egg of my actual feelings,‚Äù she said. Around this time, Ms. Kerr texted Mr. Leahy a photo of the drink menu from a bar,  the Roger Room. She had focused on a drink named for the song ‚ÄúChristmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis,‚Äù which happens to be Mr. Leahy‚Äôs favorite Tom Waits tune. ‚ÄúThis made me rethink things a bit,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúHillary Kerr was clearly not to be trifled with. ‚Äù In early 2014, Mr. Leahy invited her to a Bleachers concert. The band‚Äôs lead singer is Jack Antonoff, who is Ms. Dunham‚Äôs boyfriend. Ms. Dunham was at the concert as well, and on meeting Ms. Kerr, she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard so much about you. ‚Äù Ms. Kerr and Mr. Leahy shared their first kiss that night. He proposed to her on Polihale Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, on Jan. 1, 2016. On Dec. 10, 125 friends and relatives gathered in Palm Springs, Calif. at the Colony Palms Hotel, which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster Al Wertheimer and whose poolside guests have included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Kirk Douglas and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ms. Kerr walked down a grassy aisle in a   courtyard wearing a structured lace Reem Acra dress, strapless with a bustier and a full skirt. Four musicians played ‚ÄúOnce, With Feeling,‚Äù an instrumental song Mr. Leahy wrote for Ms. Kerr. . Just minutes into the cocktail reception, a few of Ms. Kerr‚Äôs best friends descended upon her. Jen Atkin, the celebrity hairstylist and social media star, started fussing with the flower she had sewn into the bride‚Äôs hair. Joey Maalouf, the celebrity makeup artist who is a creator of the       service the Glam App, whipped out a tube of lip gloss and reapplied it to the bride‚Äôs pucker. He had done her makeup. ‚ÄúThe look we went for is sickeningly stunning and perfect,‚Äù he said. Guests mingled over drinks by the pool, which was framed by banquette tables lit from above by strings of bulbs. The sky turned pink before the stars appeared, and guests snapped photos and shared them with the hundreds of thousands who follow these members of the   illuminati (#imwithkerr and #letsgetleahyed). ‚ÄúThis looks like it‚Äôs art directed,‚Äù Eva Chen, the head of fashion partnerships for Instagram, said as she took it all in. She had worked as an assistant at Elle with Ms. Kerr. Friends of both the bride and the groom celebrated what they saw as a great match, based on passion not only for each other but also for music. Leigh Belz Ray, the features and news director at InStyle, was another former Elle colleague who made the trip. ‚ÄúHillary loves music, and it‚Äôs not just a casual thing,‚Äù Ms. Ray said. ‚ÄúWe used to say the ultimate fantasy was to become a music director, and now she‚Äôs married to one. ‚Äù After a romantic first dance to Solomon Burke‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf You Need Me,‚Äù Mr. and Mrs. Leahy (she will use her maiden name professionally) settled into several hours of serious dancing to songs spun by a D. J. And before they left for their Hawaiian honeymoon, Mr. Leahy completed his first important act as husband. He pulled together many of the songs that could be considered the soundtrack to their romance and made his wife a mixtape. When Dec. 10, 2016 Where Colony Palms Hotel, Palm Springs, Calif. Flora The bride and groom were married under a white birch trellis, because white birch is the state tree of New Hampshire, where Mr. Leahy grew up and where his parents, Richard and Marie Leahy, reside. The structure was wrapped in white peonies, Sahara roses and camellia greens. Readings Mr. Leahy‚Äôs family is Roman Catholic Ms. Kerr‚Äôs parents, John and Carole Kerr, are more spiritual than religiously observant. Many of the guests had an artistic bent. The bride and groom planned accordingly. Marshall Goldsmith, an executive coach, author and lifelong family friend of Ms. Kerr, officiated. Friends and relatives stood to read poems from James Kavanaugh and Mary Oliver, as well as a passage from the Supreme Court‚Äôs 2015 ruling legalizing   marriage. ‚ÄúA little Catholic priest, a little lesbian Pulitzer Prize winner, a little equal rights for all,‚Äù Ms. Kerr explained after the ceremony.

| 9  | 17292 | Calling on Angels While Enduring the Trials of Job - The New York Times                        | New York Times | Andy Newman                    | 12/31/16 | 2016  | 12  |         | Angels are everywhere in the Mu√±iz family‚Äôs apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall, ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR, angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves. As Jos√© and Zoraida Mu√±iz and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks, including cancer, debilitating epilepsy, deep depression and near eviction, it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. Zoraida‚Äôs early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children‚Äôs father withdrew support. Then Zoraida‚Äôs grandfather  ‚Äî   the father of her absent father  ‚Äî   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met Jos√©, a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle, a judge, they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction, using skills she learned as a child, and in a clothing store. But in 1987, Mr. Mu√±iz began having violent seizures  ‚Äî   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life, they started a family. Their first child, Jos√© Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. That‚Äôs where the angels came in  ‚Äî   the first one was a painting, a gift from a cousin.  ‚ÄúWhen they operated on my son, they told me he was an angel, because he was supposed to die,‚Äù Ms. Mu√±iz, 50, said. ‚ÄúFrom there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. ‚Äù All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the Mu√±izes‚Äô overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, much of it restored by Ms. Mu√±iz. ‚ÄúSo many people throw away things, so I don‚Äôt have to buy,‚Äù she said. A second son, Jesus, became epileptic at 3. A girl, Maria, completed the family. In 2007, Mr. Mu√±iz had what felt like a horrible, stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. Mu√±iz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to take anything with him,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI never left him alone, and I never will. ‚Äù Radiation did not work. To save Mr. Mu√±iz‚Äôs life, surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured, depressed and unable to speak, he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the Mu√±iz children grew up. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been through every craziness,‚Äù said Jos√© Jr. 24, who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment, ‚Äúevery up and down. ‚Äù For years at a time, the family held on, seemingly by a thread. Over the summer, the younger son, Jesus, 22, got a   job at a Zaro‚Äôs Bakery in Manhattan‚Äôs financial district. Because the family‚Äôs rent is tied to income, the rent tripled in August, to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay, and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for Jos√© Sr. ‚Äôs mother, who died over the summer, and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. Mu√±iz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times‚Äôs Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent, got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund, the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college, where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness, she wants to be an oncologist. Jos√© Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film Academy‚Äôs photography program. But Jos√© Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family, sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. ‚ÄúThey give me my strength, even if I have times I collapse,‚Äù she said. Jos√© Jr. agreed. ‚ÄúI use my parents and siblings as my motivation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all there for each other,‚Äù Ms. Mu√±iz said.

| 10 | 17293 | Weak Federal Powers Could Limit Trump‚Äôs Climate-Policy Rollback - The New York Times         | New York Times | Justin Gillis                  | 1/3/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House, it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry. After all, Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax, threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory. So consider what happened in the middle of December, after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trump‚Äôs victory. The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm. Up, up and away soared the offers  ‚Äî   interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day. In the end, the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million, more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases  ‚Äî   oil leases  ‚Äî   in the Gulf of Mexico. Who won the bid? None other than Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy. We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built, but we do know this: The energy transition is real, and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it. On a global scale, more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy. That is more than $300 billion a year, a sign of how powerful the momentum has become. Wind power is booming in the United States, with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states. When Mr. Trump‚Äôs appointees examine the facts, they will learn that   technician is projected to be the   occupation in America over the next decade. The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair. They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obama‚Äôs strong push to tackle global warming. Now, of course, everything is in flux. In the worst case, with a sufficiently pliant Congress, Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change. Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trump‚Äôs part, his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda. Yet despair might be an overreaction. For starters, when Mr. Trump gets to the White House, he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy, and particularly over electricity generation. The coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas, which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced, and there is no lever in the Oval Office that Mr. Trump can pull to reverse that. The intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for Mr. Obama and his aides, but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates. They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy. Efforts to roll those back have largely failed, with the latest development coming only last week, when Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, vetoed a rollback bill. The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy, and they will surely become a target in the new Congress. But those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years, in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed Congress with many Republican votes. If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies, he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party. Topping that list is Charles E. Grassley, the senior senator from Iowa. That state  ‚Äî     in presidential politics, let us remember  ‚Äî   will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power. ‚ÄúSenator Grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry,‚Äù said Tom Kiernan, the head of the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group. When I spoke with him last week, Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era. By his group‚Äôs calculations, $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years. ‚ÄúWe are creating jobs throughout America,   jobs, and we think   Trump will want that to continue,‚Äù he said. If Mr. Trump really wanted to roll back the clock, he could try to get Congress to override all the state mandates, a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism. But it would be a titanic fight, some Republican senators would defect on principle, and Mr. Trump would almost certainly lose. So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance, what about the international effort against global warming? That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried. Dr. Victor, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, is one of the closest observers of global climate politics. While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming, that consensus is fragile, he pointed out. The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality. Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw. Right now, other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so, but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling. As part of the negotiations, the Obama administration promised billions of dollars from American taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a big part of the glue that held the Paris deal together,‚Äù Dr. Victor pointed out. Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge. Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do, but rather what he will not do. While the energy transition is real, it is still in its earliest stages. Iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind, but for the United States as a whole, the figure is closer to 5 percent. The transition is simply not happening fast enough. The pledges countries made in Paris, even if kept, are not ambitious enough. To meet the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement, the world needed an American president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition. You can debate whether Mrs. Clinton would have been that president, but it is certainly clear that Mr. Trump will not be. So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy, seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse. Later this month, global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record, beating out 2015, which beat out 2014. If nothing else, the next four years may be a fascinating test of just how far politics can become divorced from physical reality.

| 11 | 17294 | Can Carbon Capture Technology Prosper Under Trump? - The New York Times                        | New York Times | John Schwartz                  | 1/5/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | THOMPSONS, Tex.  ‚Äî   Can one of the most promising  ‚Äî   and troubled  ‚Äî   technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump? The technology, carbon capture, involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the   gas can make its way into the atmosphere. Mr. Trump‚Äôs denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change, a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees, might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives. But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here, about 30 miles southwest of Houston, is a bright spot for the technology‚Äôs supporters. It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget, unlike many previous such projects. When it fires up, the plant, which is attached to one of the power company NRG‚Äôs hulking   units, will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power. That is a fraction of the roughly 3, 700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant, the largest in the Lone Star State. Still, it is enough to capture 1. 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  ‚Äî   equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3. 5 billion miles, or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214, 338 homes. From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation, the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic, with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant‚Äôs skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors. Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture. The exhaust stream, pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment, is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines, which bond with the carbon dioxide. That solution is pumped to a regenerator, or stripper, which heats the amine and releases the CO2. The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use, and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2. Petra Nova, a   joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration, will not just grab the CO2, it will use it, pushing compressed CO2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field. The gas will be injected into wells, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, that should increase production to 15, 000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day. And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project, what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation. The plant, which has received $190 million from the federal government, can be economically viable if the price of oil is about $50 a barrel, said David Knox, an NRG spokesman. The company expects to declare the plant operational in January, Mr. Knox said. Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris, he said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to declare victory before it‚Äôs time. ‚Äù If the price of oil stabilizes or rises, and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop, he said, utilities might ask, ‚Äúwhy would I not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant?‚Äù But developing   carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy. So far, problems have bedeviled major projects, often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete. The federal government has canceled projects like Future Gen, which was granted more than $1 billion by the Obama administration. Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be   and make the plant less efficient over all  ‚Äî   a problem known as ‚Äúparasitic load. ‚Äù The Petra Nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose, which NRG says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be, and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces. The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less, thanks to lessons learned this time around. If Petra Nova succeeds, it means a boost for carbon capture. Despite carbon capture‚Äôs problems, its supporters, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency, call the technology, known as carbon capture sequestration, crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have C. C. S. the chance of success goes down, and the cost of success goes up,‚Äù said Julio Friedmann, an expert at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California and a former Energy Department official. ‚ÄúIf you do have C. C. S. the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down. ‚Äù Carbon capture is proving itself, said David Mohler, the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal Energy Department. Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially, he said. ‚ÄúYou cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle  ‚Äî   you really have to do this stuff in the real world,‚Äù he said. Driving down costs, he noted, is what engineers and businesses do through research, development and production. He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power. ‚ÄúWe do figure things out as we go,‚Äù he said. What the Trump administration will do with carbon capture is, at this point, anyone‚Äôs guess. ‚ÄúThe technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere,‚Äù said Mark Brownstein, a vice president for the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund. But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope. ‚ÄúI actually think it‚Äôs a moment of optimism,‚Äù said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who met with Mr. Trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary. Ms. Heitkamp   legislation  with another Democrat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects. ‚ÄúWhat I saw with the   was a laserlike focus on jobs,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think he was intrigued‚Äù about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix, she added. One of the pillars of Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of   clean coal. And while the exact meaning of the   phrase is open to interpretation, it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and   pollutants, but also carbon dioxide. Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses, too, were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology, since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election. ‚ÄúThe decision they are making is not, what does the political outlook look like today? What‚Äôs it look like over the life of this plant?‚Äù Although she concedes that a   revival of coal‚Äôs fortunes is unlikely, carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nation‚Äôs energy mix diverse. Jeff Erikson, general manager at the Global C. C. S. Institute, which promotes the technology, said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry,‚Äù he said, but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications. Captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes, or can even be pumped into the ground. One of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the Petra Nova plant, in La Porte, Tex. where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to   power generation. In a $140 million, 50 megawatt demonstration project, the company, Net Power, will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines. This system, invented by a British engineer, Rodney Allam, eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again. The power plant produces a stream of very pure, pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require. The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to   power plants, the efficient   plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine. That means, in effect, that ‚Äúthe cost of being green is zero,‚Äù said Bill Brown, the chief executive of Net Power. ‚ÄúThe potential to capture CO2 at no additional cost would be a game changer,‚Äù said Fatima Maria Ahmad, a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a think tank. Net Power combines the resources of Exelon Generation, a power company, the engineering and construction firm CBI, and 8 Rivers Capital, which developed the technology used in the project. The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process. And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD  ‚Äî   ‚Äúrapid unplanned disassembly‚Äù  ‚Äî   those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence. Even if the United States government shows little interest in reducing the nation‚Äôs carbon footprint under Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress, consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the United States and around the globe, where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged. ‚ÄúWe see this very much playing into all parts of the world,‚Äù said Daniel McCarthy, executive vice president for CBI‚Äôs technology operating group. Environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture, said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for Sierra Club. ‚ÄúThis is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community,‚Äù he said. Groups like the Clean Air Task Force favor it strongly. Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal, with all of its environmental baggage, in the energy mix. And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don‚Äôt pollute the atmosphere in the first place. Dr. Friedmann, the former energy official, predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs convenient to just say ‚ÄòKeep it in the ground,‚Äô ‚Äù he said, referring to an   slogan. ‚ÄúWhat I prefer to say is ‚ÄòKeep it from the air. ‚Äô‚Äù

| 12 | 17295 | Mar-a-Lago, the Future Winter White House and Home of the Calmer Trump - The New York Times    | New York Times | Maggie Haberman                | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  ‚Äî   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend, he did it in   opulence, joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone, the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump‚Äôs    resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport, Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii, staying at a private home. But Mr. Trump‚Äôs   private club in Florida, where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City, is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president‚Äôs winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post, the cereal heiress and the property‚Äôs original owner, who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973, hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan, and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million, turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. Trump‚Äôs arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite, and he opened up   ‚Äôs membership to Jews and   who had been excluded from other   establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. Trump‚Äôs victory in November,    has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long,‚Äù said Jeff Greene, a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010, who is a    member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch, upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold, beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a scene resembling a mansion in ‚ÄúSunset Boulevard‚Äù or ‚ÄúCitizen Kane,‚Äù two of Mr. Trump‚Äôs favorite movies. At night, the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd, among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next, the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New Year‚Äôs Eve party on Saturday night, a   white menu included ‚ÄúMr. Trump‚Äôs wedge salad,‚Äù a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a ‚Äúbreakfast buffet. ‚Äù Those in attendance drifted in under a    striped awning, the men dressed in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns, many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks, according to a guest, who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr, a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump, roamed the crowd, with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump‚Äôs two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning Joe‚Äù were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. Trump‚Äôs business interests, the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump‚Äôs aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at    compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump‚Äôs combative public persona  ‚Äî   often on display during his campaign  ‚Äî   mostly dissolves behind the   walls of his castle. ‚Äú   is an environment he can control,‚Äù said the historian Douglas Brinkley, who last week attended a    lunch with a longtime club member, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media. ‚ÄúI watched him hold court  ‚Äî   he was so comfortable in his own skin, and so relaxed. ‚Äù Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham, another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump, at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures, politicians and donors. He described the   as ‚Äúseeking the   Donald Trump: totally at ease, very positive, very gregarious. ‚Äù Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip, he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job, Rex W. Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him ‚ÄúMr. Exxon. ‚Äù) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs, which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at   . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns, the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy, the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment, is a    member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held   with Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member, and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim, the billionaire who is Mexico‚Äôs richest man. Mr. Trump his wife, Melania and their    son, Barron, inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio, a central point of action, where at night a singer plays with a small band, sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (‚ÄúMy Way,‚Äù a song popularized by Frank Sinatra, was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables, plucking tunes like the theme from ‚ÄúFiddler on the Roof. ‚Äù Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club, but grudgingly so  ‚Äî   he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday, slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of    old grievances flare up. On the golf course, Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt, a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago, preparing to play a round with David H. Koch, a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property, according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years, Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over    and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owner‚Äôs coming new job, the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property, at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein, a club member for nearly 25 years, said that some club members might express frustration, but that most thought it was important ‚Äúthat we keep Donald and his family safe. ‚Äù Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the   around, and expect it will continue. ‚ÄúThe loser in this game is Camp David,‚Äù said Mr. Brinkley, referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. ‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôre at    and it‚Äôs so opulent and   the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into Camp David‚Äôs Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely. ‚Äù

What did you say to your roommates on the way out the door? Salad or hamburger for lunch? When you got home, did you put on your sneakers and go for a run, or eat dinner in front of the television? Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of   decision making, but they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre habits. And though each habit means relatively little on its own, over time, the meals we eat, how we spend our evenings, and how often we exercise have enormous impacts. This is particularly true in our 20s, when so many of our habits are still up for grabs. The patterns you establish right now will impact your health, productivity, financial security and happiness for decades. How much money you make, how much time you spend with your friends and family, how well your body functions years from now  ‚Äî   all of these, in many ways, are products of the habits you are building today. (Related: The 8 health habits experts say you need in your 20s) And in the last decade, our understanding of the neurology of habit formation has been transformed. We‚Äôve learned how habits form  ‚Äî   and why they are so hard to break. We now know how to create good habits and change bad ones like never before. At the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts: A cue, a routine and a reward. To understand how to create habits  ‚Äî   such as exercise habits  ‚Äî   you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards. In 2002, researchers at New Mexico State University studied 266 individuals, most of whom worked out at least three times a week. They found that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim, or because they suddenly had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stresses in their lives. However, the reason they continued exercising  ‚Äî   why it became a habit  ‚Äî   was because of a specific cue and a specific reward. If you want to start running each morning, it‚Äôs essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or always going for a run at the same time of day) and a clear reward (like a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that, at first, the rewards inherent in exercise aren‚Äôt enough. So to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward, you need to give yourself something you really enjoy  ‚Äî   like a small piece of chocolate  ‚Äî   after your workout. This is counterintuitive, because most people start exercising to lose weight. But the goal here is to train your brain to associate a certain cue (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 5 o‚Äôclock‚Äù) with a routine (‚ÄúThree miles down! ‚Äù) and a reward (‚ÄúChocolate! ‚Äù). Eventually, your brain will start expecting the reward inherent in exercise (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 5 o‚Äôclock. Three miles down! Endorphin rush! ‚Äù) and you won‚Äôt need the chocolate anymore. In fact, you won‚Äôt even want it. But until your neurology learns to enjoy those endorphins and the other rewards inherent in exercise, you need to   the process. And then, over time, it will become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. You won‚Äôt want the chocolate anymore. You‚Äôll just crave the endorphins.

| 14 | 17297 | Turning Your Vacation Photos Into Works of Art - The New York Times                            | New York Times | Stephanie Rosenbloom           | 4/14/17  | 2017  | 4   |         | It‚Äôs the season for family travel and photos  ‚Äî   and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home. There are, of course, the usual print services and methods. You can choose a glossy or matte finish, print a photo on canvas, or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly, professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix, or drugstores and   chains like Walgreens and Costco. But the web is also home to many   printing services, as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display, be it burlap, wood boards, acrylic or    fabric. Why not try some fresh sites and methods? I recently sent some   quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that I‚Äôd never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces. I‚Äôve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation, then with a   home. Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art, I was most interested in trying engineer prints, named for the large, lightweight prints used by architects. For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets, you can make huge enlargements. Mind you, it‚Äôs a particular aesthetic, one that‚Äôs most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial, shabby chic or bohemian look. The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print. And engineer prints need not be formally framed. People stick them to their walls with washi tape, a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips. For a while, engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white, but now you can find them in color, too. One of the easiest ways to order them online is through Parabo Press, which is run by Photojojo, an online photography gear shop, and Zoomin, a photo printing service in Asia. As with all printing sites, you upload your image, zoom in closer if you like, and then click to buy. The site‚Äôs engineer prints are 4 feet by 3 feet, and cost $20 in black and white, and $25 in color. I sent out two different photos to be made in black and white, and they came out, to my surprise, beautifully. I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry. And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful, careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch. Parabo Press is a breeze to use: It‚Äôs clean and easy to read, your options are straightforward, and there are no annoying upsells. The site also offers prints on metal, glass, newsprint and Zines (handmade magazines) calendars photo books and prints from its Risograph machine, which uses   ink and is described by Parabo as having ‚Äúa cult following since its invention in 1980s Japan. ‚Äù A fabric print  ‚Äî   not soft like a bedsheet, more like a place mat made of matte woven fabric  ‚Äî   is another departure from a traditional photo enlargement. Order one from a site such as SnapBox and instead of framing it, you can peel and stick it on your wall. The site‚Äôs fabric posters adhere to (and can be peeled off) smooth surfaces such as untextured walls, glass, ceilings, tile and finished wood surfaces (avoid surfaces like stucco, concrete blocks, brick, unfinished wood, canvas or freshly painted walls). SnapBox offers fabric posters in more than a dozen sizes from 4x4 to 36x54, from less than $2 to about $80. I ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for $34. 99, a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon  ‚Äî   not cheap (you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less) but you‚Äôre printing on special material. Regardless of the cost, I expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room (it sticks to walls, after all) but I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric was durable and the details in the photo  ‚Äî   crevasses in a glacier onlookers on a bridge  ‚Äî   were nicely defined. SnapBox is a   site with clear instructions and pricing. In addition to fabric posters, it also offers fine art prints, photo books and prints on canvas and pillows. While many places can print photos on hard surfaces such as metal and acrylic, printing on wood boards is less common. The grain shows through your photos, which, thematically speaking, seems to make sense for certain subjects, like nature photos taken at, say, the beach or in a park. But what would something more modern, like a skyscraper or a tower, look like on wood? I decided to give it a try and put an image of Tokyo Tower on an 8x12 board ($65). I sent the photo to PhotoBarn, a family business that makes its products by hand in a ‚Äú ‚Äù in Tennessee. The result was a lovely departure from framed prints and from canvas, which can sometimes make striking photos look like amateur paintings. The wood was smooth and thick, and the image was crisp with a slight sheen  ‚Äî   a perfect complement to the steel of Tokyo tower and the silver and glass of surrounding skyscrapers. For the most part the site is intuitive, though a few too many holiday sale buttons on the home page made for a disorienting start. PhotoBarn will also print your photos on canvas, burlap, and other wood products, like ornaments. I noticed a number of complaints about PhotoBarn on Yelp and the Better Business Bureau website regarding shipping speeds and customer service. I didn‚Äôt have a problem, but if time is of the essence, you may want to check with the company before placing an order. Once you‚Äôve turned the best of your travel photos into art, it‚Äôs time to store the rest. If boxes of prints are taking up closet (and psychic) space, there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos (as well as negatives, slides and videos) so you can store them digitally. But there are several things to keep in mind. In general, these sites are a pain to navigate. They‚Äôre cluttered with too much text and fine print, and they offer so many options  ‚Äî   Do you want your photos scanned in order? Do you want both sides of the photo scanned?  ‚Äî   that if you don‚Äôt have a goal in mind before you go in, you can quickly be overwhelmed. Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan, how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan. Also, note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files. Not everyone has a CD or DVD player. If you want a thumb drive instead, be sure to select that option (if it‚Äôs offered) or call the company and see if it will provide one. Be aware, too, that it‚Äôs not unusual for these companies to have long lead times. A number of them digitize your photos in other countries, so it can take weeks to get your images back. For affordable bulk scans, ScanMyPhotos. com is an old standby (you can read David Pogue‚Äôs review on nytimes. com). The company will scan about 1, 800 photos at 300 dpi for $145 at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. the cost of sending the photo box to you, as well as the shipping of the box to ScanMyPhotos and back to you again is included in the price. That‚Äôs one of the least costly and most uncomplicated deals around. Other companies charge for shipping photo boxes. I asked a photo editor at The Times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes, a higher dpi is preferable. ScanMyPhotos has such an option: a prepaid box for $259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi. A thumb drive is an additional $15. 95 a box. To find the best   place to scan photos and film, the Wirecutter, a consumer review site owned by The New York Times, researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders. Memories Renewed took the number one spot. The company, based in Minneapolis, Minn. offered ‚Äúthe best combination of price, quality, and turnaround time of any service we tested,‚Äù Wirecutter said. I was planning to try the service however, according to the Memories Renewed site, demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months. Scanning photos of any size up to 8. 5x11 is 60 cents a photo a thumb drive is $10 for 8 GB or $15 for 16 GB. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt want to ship your irreplaceable photos in the mail. Or maybe you‚Äôd rather that strangers not see your photos and home videos. You could buy a scanner and scan your photos yourself, perhaps doing a batch for half an hour each day. Personally, I don‚Äôt want machines around my home collecting dust (and fast becoming outdated). So I decided to try the new PhotoScan app by Google Photos. It‚Äôs free and enables users to scan prints with a smartphone. First things first: These are not   scans. If you have prized photos in need of restoration, then go with a professional. However if, like me, you have a bunch of travel photos  ‚Äî   landscapes, food, monuments  ‚Äî   that you‚Äôre keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when, you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of $150. By and large, PhotoScan is simple and quick, with almost no learning curve. If you try it, just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image. Remember these words: Don‚Äôt tilt your phone! Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity. That said, this is unlikely to be your solution if you want   prints or have thousands of photos to scan. Once you get the hang of PhotoScan, using it becomes a repetitive, vaguely   activity. That is, unless the app crashes, which it did several times. But I was still glad for it. Even when it crashed, it took only the tap of a finger to begin again. And you can‚Äôt beat the price.

| 15 | 17298 | As Second Avenue Subway Opens, a Train Delay Ends in (Happy) Tears - The New York Times        | New York Times | Emma G. Fitzsimmons            | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017, and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers, they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes, taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. ‚ÄúI was very choked up,‚Äù Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon. ‚ÄúHow do you explain something that you never thought would happen? It‚Äôs going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. ‚Äù It was a major moment for New York‚Äôs sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  ‚Äî   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  ‚Äî   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nation‚Äôs most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs  ‚Äî   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement, the line, with just three new stops, is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still, there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation‚Äôs infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  ‚Äî   in New York, Washington and Boston  ‚Äî   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls, with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city‚Äôs vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening, the map of the city‚Äôs loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472  ‚Äî   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattan‚Äôs Far West Side in 2015 was the city‚Äôs first new station in a  . On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop, Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen,‚Äù she said through tears. ‚ÄúThis woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. ‚Äù She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. ‚ÄúRepresentation matters,‚Äù they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria, Queens, said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics, including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. ‚ÄúThere is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York,‚Äù Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013, but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still, the agency made the deadline  ‚Äî   just barely  ‚Äî   with a lavish inaugural ride on New Year‚Äôs Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authority‚Äôs chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening, some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority‚Äôs chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs voice came over the loudspeaker. ‚ÄúRest assured: I‚Äôm not driving the train,‚Äù he joked. The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier, the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,‚Äù the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. ‚ÄúHopefully, it‚Äôs almost ready for us. ‚Äù It was not, and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. ‚ÄúWould you look at that guy?‚Äù Mr. Braith, 77, said. ‚ÄúPretty handsome fellow if you ask me. ‚Äù He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork, including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. Braith‚Äôs mosaic, he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone, alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. ‚ÄúAre you famous?‚Äù a   asked, seeing the hubbub. ‚ÄúIn the jazz world,‚Äù Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre immortalized as far as I‚Äôm concerned. ‚Äù Another   celebrant, Ian Ma, 15, lives in Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child, he said, and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve been waiting for this train my whole life,‚Äù he said, seemingly speaking for many others.

| 16 | 17300 | Dylann Roof Himself Rejects Best Defense Against Execution - The New York Times                | New York Times | Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder    | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         |   pages into the   journal found in Dylann S. Roof‚Äôs car  ‚Äî   after the assertions of black inferiority, the lamentations over white powerlessness, the longing for a race war  ‚Äî   comes an incongruous declaration. ‚ÄúI want state that I am morally opposed to psychology,‚Äù wrote the young white supremacist who would murder nine black worshipers at Emanuel A. M. E. Church in Charleston, S. C. in June 2015. ‚ÄúIt is a Jewish invention, and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they dont. ‚Äù Mr. Roof, who plans to represent himself when the penalty phase of his federal capital trial begins on Tuesday, apparently is devoted enough to that proposition (or delusion, as some maintain) to stake his life on it. Although a defense based on his psychological capacity might be his best opportunity to avoid execution, he seems steadfastly committed to preventing any public examination of his mental state or background. ‚ÄúI will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence,‚Äù he wrote to Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court on Dec. 16, a day after a jury took only two hours to find him guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death, obstruction of religion and firearms violations. At a hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Roof told the judge that he planned to make an opening statement but not call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf. The testimony presented by prosecutors during the guilt phase of Mr. Roof‚Äôs trial detailed with gruesome precision how he had plotted and executed the massacre during a Wednesday night Bible study in the church‚Äôs fellowship hall. It was less satisfying in revealing why he had done it. With his choice to sideline his legal team and represent himself, the second phase  ‚Äî   when the same jury of nine whites and three blacks will decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison  ‚Äî   may prove little different. Death penalty experts said it was exceedingly rare for capital defendants to represent themselves after allowing lawyers to handle the initial part of a case. Mr. Roof, who also faces a death penalty trial in state court, has not publicly explained his reasoning. But legal filings strongly suggest a split with his   defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness. Mr. Roof‚Äôs lead lawyer, David I. Bruck, tried repeatedly to plant that notion during the guilt phase, knowing it might be his only chance. Because evidence of mitigating factors is supposed to be reserved for the penalty phase, Judge Gergel allowed him little leeway. In his closing argument, while acknowledging Mr. Roof‚Äôs guilt, Mr. Bruck managed to tell the jury that Mr. Roof subscribed to ‚Äúthe mad idea that he can make things better by massacring the most virtuous, kind and gentle people he could ever have found. ‚Äù Mr. Bruck seeded his speech with words like ‚Äúabnormal,‚Äù ‚Äúirrationality,‚Äù ‚Äúsenselessness,‚Äù ‚Äúdelusional,‚Äù ‚Äúobsession‚Äù and ‚Äúperseveration,‚Äù a psychiatric term referring to the uncontrollable repetition of a particular response. Mr. Bruck, one of the country‚Äôs most experienced death penalty litigators, portrayed his    client as a loner whose most meaningful relationship seemed to be with his cat who staged hundreds of photographs of himself with no sign of friends whose racial hatred was ignited by internet searches and not personal experience who could not pinpoint during his confession to the F. B. I. how many he had killed, how long he had spent at the church or even what month it was who had no escape plan and left suicide notes to his parents. ‚ÄúThere was something in him that made him feel that he had to do it,‚Äù Mr. Bruck said, ‚Äúand that is as much as he knows. ‚Äù After receiving the results of a psychiatric examination in November, Judge Gergel found Mr. Roof competent to stand trial  ‚Äî   meaning that he was capable of understanding the proceedings and assisting in his defense. At Mr. Bruck‚Äôs request, the judge scheduled a second competency hearing for Monday, but he signaled last week that he saw no reason to delay the penalty phase. The judge has repeatedly warned Mr. Roof against representing himself, including immediately after the verdicts, when he called it ‚Äúa bad decision‚Äù and urged him to ‚Äúfully appreciate the implications. ‚Äù The warnings have had no discernible effect on Mr. Roof, who has until Tuesday to reverse his decision to relegate his lawyers to standby counsel. That status allows Mr. Bruck and his team to offer guidance, but not to question witnesses or make objections. Prosecutors plan a procession of grief, perhaps calling dozens of members of victims‚Äô families to testify about the impact of the killings. The prosecutors are also likely to   the considerable evidence of Mr. Roof‚Äôs premeditation and clearly articulated racial intent. Death penalty experts said the absence of mental health evidence to mitigate those aggravating factors could be decisive. ‚ÄúIf the jury views Roof as evil and having made a knowing, intelligent choice to kill these innocent, churchgoing people in order to foment racial hatred, they are much more likely to impose the death penalty than if they believe him to be a young and severely mentally ill person who acted under delusional racist beliefs,‚Äù said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a research group. It would take only one holdout on the jury, which consists of 10 women and two men, to spare Mr. Roof from lethal injection. Judge Gergel has ruled that the jurors can be told that prosecutors had rejected Mr. Roof‚Äôs offer, through Mr. Bruck, to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Many in Charleston were relieved by Mr. Roof‚Äôs conviction in light of the mistrial that had been declared 10 days earlier in the state murder prosecution of Michael T. Slager, the white North Charleston policeman whose fatal shooting of a black motorist in 2015 was captured on video. Even those who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds, like the Rev. Joseph A. Darby, a presiding elder for the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, said it would seem bewildering for Mr. Roof to escape capital punishment. ‚ÄúThat could very well be the end of the death penalty in America, because if there was ever justification for killing anybody, this is the case,‚Äù Mr. Darby said. There is no consensus among members of the victims‚Äô families about Mr. Roof‚Äôs fate. When the Justice Department elected in May to seek the death penalty, it acted against the wishes of many and of the two women he had spared. Five relatives offered Mr. Roof a measure of forgiveness at a remarkable bond hearing two days after the shootings. But by law, those who testify now are prohibited from telling the jury what penalty they think he should receive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be extremely emotional, powerful testimony,‚Äù said John H. Blume, a death penalty expert who teaches at Cornell Law School, ‚Äúand that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when it‚Äôs not the case. ‚Äù If Mr. Roof is sentenced to death, it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law, according to experts on capital cases. That statute, which was broadened in 2009, does not carry a potential death sentence, but Mr. Roof was also convicted of other crimes that do. A death sentence most likely would give way to a yearslong series of appeals (in which Mr. Roof could not represent himself). Among the issues could be the composition of the jury, given that Mr. Roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and Mr. Roof‚Äôs competence to stand trial and to represent himself. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Indiana v. Edwards that trial judges could insist on legal representation for defendants who are ‚Äúcompetent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves. ‚Äù Mr. Bruck and his team have argued in court filings that Mr. Roof, a   dropout, ‚Äúhas no right to represent himself in a capital trial, and even less so at the penalty phase. ‚Äù But in the 41 years since the Supreme Court recognized a Sixth Amendment right of   for criminal defendants, in Faretta v. California, the court has never specifically narrowed that holding for death penalty trials, despite their complexity. Some death penalty opponents hope that Mr. Roof‚Äôs defiance will prompt the appellate courts to adopt a more rigorous standard for capital defendants. ‚ÄúWhether or not they‚Äôre legally insane, there‚Äôs certainly something mentally wrong with them,‚Äù said Peter D. Greenspun, a lawyer who was ousted by a defendant, John A. Muhammad, for part of a capital murder trial for the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington area. He added, ‚ÄúTo have a person like that make this kind of decision, it really calls into question, from a philosophical point of view, whether that person is in a position to understand their civil

| 17 | 17301 | Modi‚Äôs Cash Ban Brings Pain, but Corruption-Weary India Grits Its Teeth - The New York Times | New York Times | Geeta Anand                    | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | MUMBAI, India  ‚Äî   It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India, which came into full effect at midnight Friday, the last day for depositing the old notes at banks, set off cash shortages that have hit the country‚Äôs most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modi‚Äôs bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime minister‚Äôs initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as ‚Äúblack money,‚Äù flowing through the country‚Äôs economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. ‚ÄúEven though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country,‚Äù said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children‚Äôs school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, ‚ÄúWe need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me. ‚Äù Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1, 000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning. With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good. That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for   Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. ‚ÄúTrump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system,‚Äù Mr. Prasad said in an interview. ‚ÄúModi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can‚Äôt tackle   problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones. ‚Äù Mr. Modi appeared on television on New Year‚Äôs Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. ‚ÄúToday Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate,‚Äù Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi. ‚ÄúAs we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha,‚Äù he said, referring to Gandhi‚Äôs nonviolent resistance movement, ‚Äúlet us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness. ‚Äù Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the   major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little bit crazy,‚Äù said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. ‚ÄúWhen I first read the news, I couldn‚Äôt even figure out if it was true. ‚Äù The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  ‚Äî   more than 250, 000 rupees, or about $3, 670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. Whether Mr. Modi‚Äôs   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected. Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India‚Äôs ossified and bureaucratic economy. But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a   hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane. ‚ÄúIf this move damages the economy, he‚Äôs in for a rough ride,‚Äù said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. ‚ÄúYou need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,‚Äù he said. Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the country‚Äôs   life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. ‚ÄúIn 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter,‚Äù Mr. Pant said. ‚ÄúHe was the precursor to what‚Äôs happening in the West. ‚Äù Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the country‚Äôs red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified    tax. He cast the opposition as ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt want change, who don‚Äôt want reform,‚Äù Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes. But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said. Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1, 000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. ‚ÄúSo if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?‚Äù he asked. Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt shift to a cashless mode overnight,‚Äù he said. Surjit Bhalla, a New   economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said. Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said. But doing so depends on Mr. Modi‚Äôs continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. ‚ÄúSo far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,‚Äù Mr. Pant said. ‚ÄúHe thinks he can continue to do it, but we really don‚Äôt know. There are so many unknowns. ‚Äù

| 18 | 17302 | Suicide Bombing in Baghdad Kills at Least 36 - The New York Times                              | New York Times | The Associated Press           | 1/3/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | BAGHDAD  ‚Äî   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President Fran√ßois Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider   Iraq‚Äôs prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers‚Äô shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber‚Äôs vehicle, trying to get hired. ‚ÄúThen a big boom came, sending them up into the air,‚Äù said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed ‚Äúthe most ineffective security forces in the world‚Äù for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital‚Äôs six million residents. ‚ÄúWe have no idea who will kill at any moment and who‚Äôs supposed to protect us,‚Äù said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. ‚ÄúIf the securities forces can‚Äôt protect us, then allow us to do the job. ‚Äù Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a ‚Äú  incident,‚Äù without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.

| 19 | 17303 | Fecal Pollution Taints Water at Melbourne‚Äôs Beaches After Storm - The New York Times         | New York Times | Brett Cole                     | 1/3/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | SYDNEY, Australia  ‚Äî   The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne, Australia‚Äôs   city, is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement. The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers, creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem,‚Äù said Anthony Boxshall, the agency‚Äôs manager of applied sciences, noting that the waste was coming from people, dogs, horses, cows, birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems, including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the   Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip, affecting the city‚Äôs bayside beaches the most. The agency, which takes regular water samples, rates beaches. A ‚Äúgood‚Äù rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. ‚ÄúFair‚Äù means that rainfall has affected the water. ‚ÄúPoor‚Äù means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. ‚ÄúWhen the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit, Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach,‚Äù said Sam Riley, who lives in the city. ‚ÄúI was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer, but now I‚Äôm concerned about whether the water is clean. ‚Äù Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches‚Äô water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued. The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops.

| 20 | 17305 | N.F.L. Playoffs: Schedule, Matchups and Odds - The New York Times                              | New York Times | Benjamin Hoffman               | 1/3/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11, dropping to   Aaron Rodgers vowed to ‚Äúrun the table‚Äù in a march to the playoffs. With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night, the team fulfilled Rodgers‚Äô promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants, thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams, but the N. F. C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team‚Äôs sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done, ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks‚Äô title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury, the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions, who lost their final three games, blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East, home of the   Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas, Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. ‚Äôs division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17‚Äôs loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team‚Äôs quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the team‚Äôs   running back, they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami‚Äôs middling defense, even if Tannehill‚Äôs knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England, Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the Redskins‚Äô plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the team‚Äôs quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carr‚Äôs backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia.

| 21 | 17306 | Mariah Carey‚Äôs Manager Blames Producers for New Year‚Äôs Eve Nightmare - The New York Times  | New York Times | Patrick Healy                  | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New Year‚Äôs Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song ‚ÄúEmotions,‚Äù struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music. The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers, ‚ÄúWe Belong Together,‚Äù while a recording of the song continued to play, a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday, a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey‚Äôs representatives and producers of ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúDick Clark‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs Rockin‚Äô Eve With Ryan Seacrest,‚Äù on which the singer was performing. Ms. Carey‚Äôs manager, Stella Bulochnikov, charged that the show‚Äôs producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  ‚Äî   and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey‚Äôs messy performance ‚Äúto get ratings. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI will never know the truth, but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production,‚Äù Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Year‚Äôs Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there, and they did not have their‚Äù act together. Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show, issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey‚Äôs performance woes had nothing to do with the production, and that any suggestion that the company ‚Äúwould ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. ‚Äù ‚ÄúIn very rare instances, there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television,‚Äù the statement said, adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company ‚Äúhad no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs Eve performance. ‚Äù A veteran audio producer, Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International, a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years, also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. ‚ÄúEvery monitor and   device worked perfectly,‚Äù Mr. Goldstein said. ‚Äú I can‚Äôt comment beyond that and don‚Äôt know what her nontechnical issue may have been. ‚Äù A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. ‚ÄúUnfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances,‚Äù the spokeswoman, Nicole Perna, told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey, a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years, was the final   act on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúDick Clark‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs Rockin‚Äô Eve With Ryan Seacrest. ‚Äù She had just finished ‚ÄúAuld Lang Syne‚Äù when her star turn began to spiral out of control. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt hear,‚Äù she said in the opening seconds of ‚ÄúEmotions‚Äù after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played, Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just sing,‚Äù and noted proudly of her song, ‚ÄúIt went to No. 1. ‚Äù But she could not manage the notes that followed, and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLet the audience sing. ‚Äù ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage, and at one point seemed to defend herself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to be a good sport here,‚Äù she said. When the number ended, the crowd cheered her on. ‚ÄúThat was  ‚Äî   ‚Äù she said, pausing for effect, ‚Äúamazing. ‚Äù She seemed to recover at first with ‚ÄúWe Belong Together,‚Äù but there appeared to be another malfunction, and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time, the prerecorded number kept playing. ‚ÄúIt just don‚Äôt get any better,‚Äù she said, and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance, Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an ‚Äúupset‚Äù emoji, then wrote: ‚ÄúHave a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here‚Äôs to making more headlines in 2017. ‚Äù An ABC spokesman said on Sunday that the network would not comment on the problems with Ms. Carey‚Äôs performance.

| 22 | 17307 | Damaged by War, Syria‚Äôs Cultural Sites Rise Anew in France - The New York Times              | New York Times | Marlise Simons                 | 1/1/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | PARIS  ‚Äî   When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March, Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria‚Äôs director of antiquities to come over in a hurry. An architect by training, Mr. Ubelmann, 36, had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war. But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects, mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites. Palmyra, parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous, was still rigged with explosives. So he and Houmam Saad, his Syrian colleague, spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples. ‚ÄúDrones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details, every crack and hole, and we can take very precise measurements,‚Äù said Mr. Ubelmann, who founded the company Iconem. ‚ÄúThis is the stuff architects and archaeologists need. ‚Äù They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists, archaeologists and others, like Mr. Ubelmann, are compiling on a large scale. The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored, repaired or reconstructed. Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria, and also Iraq, that have suffered from war, looting and the Islamic State. ‚ÄúPalmyra was very difficult,‚Äù Mr. Ubelmann said. ‚ÄúThe terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture. It became a war of images. ‚Äù The latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the Grand Palais in Paris, where, through Jan. 9, many of the 40, 000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays. Called ‚ÄúEternal Sites: From Bamiyan to Palmyra,‚Äù the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage. To underscore the exhibition‚Äôs political importance, it was opened several weeks ago by President Fran√ßois Hollande of France, who described it as ‚Äúan act of resistance‚Äù against terror and intolerance. Showing the beauty of the Middle Eastern heritage, he said, ‚Äúis the best answer to the Islamist propaganda of hate, destruction and death. ‚Äù   Martinez, the director of the Louvre and the lead curator of the show, said the sites had been chosen because ‚Äúall are under threat from pillaging, neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public. ‚Äù He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion ‚Äúin the face of the devastation of unique heritage. ‚Äù Besides images from Palmyra, the multimedia show projects enormous   photographs and videos, immersing visitors in different eras, including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an   mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel. Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president, Bashar  . ‚ÄúWe were working pro bono, not for any government, but to help the archaeologists,‚Äù he said. They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists, he said, adding, ‚ÄúWe also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own. ‚Äù What is paramount is memory and potential restoration. In the last year, his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria. Recently, it moved into   zones in Iraq, close to the front line in the fight against the Islamic State. The team is now analyzing the war‚Äôs effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3, 000 years, including Nineveh, Khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of Nimrud, where the government drove out the jihadists in November. In 2015, Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their   campaign. ‚ÄúNimrud was probably the most splendid of the Assyrian cities,‚Äù Layla Abdulkarim, a Syrian architect, said as she analyzed aerial photographs. Using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new, specialists say, but at a recent gathering in Paris researchers from Europe and the Middle East said they were now having to practice ‚Äúwar archaeology,‚Äù that is, collecting reliable data from   areas. The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable. But these were barely scratching the surface. Before the war, close to 150 archaeological projects were underway, just in Syria, researchers said. Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in Syria‚Äôs old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria, the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing. There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing. ‚ÄúPeople are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms, but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible,‚Äù said Pascal Butterlin, a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Time is of the essence, even in the case of    ruins, Mr. Butterlin said. He has led expeditions for more than 20 years to Mari, near Syria‚Äôs border with Iraq. Before fleeing, the guards at Mari reported that looters had come from Iraq, he said. ‚ÄúWe need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúImportant evidence, like clandestine pits, can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion. ‚Äù Cheikhmous Ali, a Syrian archaeologist based in France, who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology, said reports of organized pillaging continued. A first wave of looting began in 2012, Mr. Ali said, and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the Islamic State. While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts, they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money. Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed, objects carted off, safes stolen. The exhibition in Paris, which is drawing large crowds, coincides with ‚ÄúHistory Begins in Mesopotamia,‚Äù a show at the Louvre‚Äôs regional museum in Lens. Both exhibitions highlight the French government‚Äôs active concern about cultural damage in Syria, which was briefly controlled by France in the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest, condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as ‚Äúwar crimes. ‚Äù This past month, France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates, provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments. At the ‚ÄúEternal Sites‚Äù opening at the Grand Palais, Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population. ‚ÄúShould we be concerned about the patrimony?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúWhat is more important, saving lives or saving stones? In reality, these two are inseparable. ‚Äù

| 23 | 17308 | George Michael‚Äôs Freedom Video: An Oral History - The New York Times                         | New York Times | Guy Trebay and Jacob Bernstein | 1/1/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | Pop music and fashion never met cuter than in George Michael‚Äôs ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù video. Sure, other catwalk favorites starred in music videos during that era, and fashion photographers like Steven Meisel and Herb Ritts were recruited by stars such as Madonna, Chris Isaak and Janet Jackson to burnish their visuals. But the convergence of a   maker‚Äôs irresistible rhythms and lyrics, a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a  . Directed by David Fincher, who was at the start of his film career, and filmed over several days at Merton Park Studios in London, the video from Mr. Michael‚Äôs 1990 album, ‚ÄúListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,‚Äù brought together five models  ‚Äî   Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz  ‚Äî   who were then the queens of fashion. It runs for six and a half minutes, and its production also gathered a team of novice professionals who would go on to become major forces in fashion, including the stylist Camilla Nickerson, the hairdresser Guido Palau, the makeup artist Carol Brown and the model John Pearson. Shot in moody, romantic   tones, ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù had been viewed more than 37 million times on YouTube by the time of Mr. Michael‚Äôs unexpected death at 53 last Sunday. Reached by phone this week, some of the participants recalled their experiences on set, and some of the video‚Äôs most ardent fans reflected on its impact. Naomi Campbell, model. We‚Äôd done a British Vogue cover with Peter Lindbergh with all of us. I met George in L. A. and he said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told that I need to speak to you to get the girls for the video. What would it take to get you?‚Äù We were living in America, so I said you‚Äôd have to fly us in, basically. I said yes, and then Christy and Tatjana and everyone came in. The night before the video, I didn‚Äôt sleep at all, because we did five shows for Thierry Mugler in Paris. He had 76 models, and it was the big finale of him designing, although none of us knew that then. The last show finished at around 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning, and George was there. So from there I went back to my hotel, packed my bags and went on the first flight to London. David Fincher knew exactly what he wanted. He didn‚Äôt really give us parts, but he knew exactly which part of the song he wanted each and every one of us to sing. I was more the active one. Cindy was sultry. I don‚Äôt think any of us knew what it would become. We knew the song was a hit, but we didn‚Äôt know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos, the way it would affect people. We were all really excited on the day it was going to be aired. They all had great premieres back in the day. They don‚Äôt have them anymore. Not that I‚Äôve seen. MTV‚Äôs changed. Hasn‚Äôt it? I got to see George a little bit more after that because Kate Moss was neighbors with him. When we did the Olympics, he sang there in London. We all did the finale, and he was rehearsing and Kate and I went to watch him with this amazing choir singing ‚ÄúFreedom. ‚Äù After, he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice   in the garden, and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together. That‚Äôs the memory I‚Äôm going to keep. Guido Palau, hairdresser. I don‚Äôt know how I got the job. George Michael and David Fincher had seen some of my work in British Vogue. It was a different time then. It was a big, big production, a   video because they had to bring in all the girls. Every girl had a day, though Christy and Linda were there together. My part was to make the girls the best they could look as who they were. They weren‚Äôt playing characters. They were playing themselves. And each had their own personality: Linda the comedian, Christy much more classic, Cindy the pinup, Tatjana this kind of film noir, and Naomi a very strong kind of woman. We extracted that from them. They weren‚Äôt prodded at all, though there were some surprises, like Linda‚Äôs hair, which she‚Äôd done for a job for someone else. It wasn‚Äôt like I said, ‚ÄúOh, dye your hair blond,‚Äù not at all. At the time, we really didn‚Äôt realize how iconic the video would become. I was probably a bit na√Øve about the whole thing seeing how it was a bit of a   job for me. What I remember most is the days being very long, and at the end of the day, the red wine would come out. There we‚Äôd be in the location van drinking and singing with George. Tatjana Patitz, model. I was in my own zone. I had to kind of slide up and down the wall for part of the day. The feel of the set was so   this big, loft kind of vibe. There was another setup with me laying on a chaise longue with a black smoking jacket. I think I may have had a bustier on. And I was smoking, even. People still smoked in videos then and even in films. George Michael wasn‚Äôt on the set the day I was there, but I‚Äôd met him a few times in L. A. Herb Ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine  ‚Äî   I‚Äôm trying to remember what magazine it was. So many magazines have come and gone. Glamour was very present in fashion in those days, feminine glamour, people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the ‚Äô40s and ‚Äô50s  ‚Äî   Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner. A lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers. It was very different those days. The business was much smaller and wasn‚Äôt as saturated, not as fast as it is now. Models were known by their first names, and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film. We were part of the entertainment industry, which made it really fun. George was very nice, almost a little shy. Maybe that‚Äôs the wrong word. He was mellow and kind. I was quite   at the time because I grew up with Wham and their music he was one of my first teenage crushes. In the five or so times I met him, he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid, not one of those vivacious,   people who take a room by storm. I remember the shoot being in fall or early winter. I flew in on the Concorde for the day and flew back to New York right after that. It‚Äôs funny. A lot of people were using models in videos then, but this one in particular stood the test of time. It‚Äôs not like you look at ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù now and say, ‚ÄúOh, my God, it‚Äôs so ‚Äô80s!‚Äù It‚Äôs not like ‚ÄúWorking Girl. ‚Äù John Pearson, model. My agent called up and said: ‚ÄúHey, do you want to do this video? All the big girls are doing it. ‚Äô‚Äù Of course I said yes. I was a big George Michael fan. I used to see him all the time in London at the clubs. I arrived at the studios at 3 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon and met David Fincher briefly, and then basically sat around all day and watched while Christy and Linda were being shot. There‚Äôs one shot where Linda puts her head underneath her sweater that‚Äôs amazing. That wasn‚Äôt rehearsed. Linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way, never cheap and tawdry. George was there, very warm and nice but very shy. The day went long, and the producer said at the end of the day, ‚ÄúCan we shoot you tomorrow?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have another job booked, so I said, ‚ÄúSure. ‚Äù Then he said, ‚ÄúDo you mind doing it for nothing?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúNo way. ‚Äù It was a little bit bolshie of me, but I knew what the girls were getting. In the end, I was paid $15, 000 for the day, which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous, beautiful girls. But I‚Äôd been working nonstop for three years, and I wasn‚Äôt going to do it for free. And it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy,    jobs, everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models. I really didn‚Äôt realize how big it all was at the time. Candis Cayne, actress, model and former drag personality. There was a group of girls in N. Y. C. in the ‚Äô90s, and we didn‚Äôt want to model ourselves on anything other than the supermodels. Linda and Naomi and Christy. So when the video of ‚ÄúFreedom!‚Äù came out and they were all in it, we were obsessed. I used to do shows at Boy Bar, so I decided I was going to do ‚ÄúFreedom!‚Äù and got Lina and Mistress Formika and Sherry Vine to play the various parts. I was Linda. She was my favorite. We did the whole thing naked under white sheets. After the very last chorus, we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas. That song meant a lot to us. There were singers we knew were gay then, but no one really talked about it. We just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were, whether it was Madonna with ‚ÄúVogue‚Äù and ‚ÄúTruth or Dare‚Äù or George Michael with ‚ÄúFreedom!‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if he was openly gay or not, then. I guess not. But it was almost O. K. because we all knew and it was such a homophobic time. It was so oppressive, particularly when you factor in the AIDS epidemic. To be open would have been a career killer. But going to a club, listening to ‚ÄúFreedom! ,‚Äù it was an escape. Alan Hunter, one of the original MTV V. J. s. It was a funny moment in my life. I was driving my kid to day care on a day where I didn‚Äôt know where my career had gone. I‚Äôd left MTV. My agent wasn‚Äôt calling. I was depressed. And I turned on the radio, and on came George Michael‚Äôs new song. It was George Michael at the peak of his writing skills. It was such a brilliant   capstone I‚Äôd ever heard. It was his    song. He was saying, ‚ÄúEverything that brought me to pop stardom I now disavow. ‚Äù Then I saw the video shortly thereafter with all that iconography he‚Äôd used in his past, and he literally sets those things on fire and explodes them. The leather jacket he‚Äôd worn and the jukebox from ‚ÄúFaith. ‚Äù And he just steps away. He wasn‚Äôt even in the video. It showed how serious he was, even while he said it all with a lot of love. It was such a joyous song. I actually felt happy. Zac Posen, fashion designer. I was 10 years old, 10 or 11. I‚Äôd see it in my living room waiting for Madonna to come on. I probably wanted to be the child in ‚ÄúOpen Your Heart. ‚Äù But what I remember about ‚ÄúFreedom!‚Äù was that it was kind of a seminal predecessor to grunge. Because you have these incredibly glamorous beauties in a very industrial, Corinne Day,   space. There‚Äôs water dripping down the walls and George Michael‚Äôs leather jacket is on fire, and the models are naked. It was really the glamour of the ‚Äô80s transitioning into something more raw that was to come.

| 24 | 17309 | With New Congress Poised to Convene, Obama‚Äôs Policies Are in Peril - The New York Times      | New York Times | Jennifer Steinhauer            | 1/2/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | WASHINGTON  ‚Äî   The most powerful and ambitious   Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life  ‚Äî   refashioning the country‚Äôs social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration. Even before   Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities  ‚Äî   most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a   Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump‚Äôs cabinet nominees. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,‚Äù said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. ‚ÄúAnd we intend to do it. ‚Äù But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party‚Äôs brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. Trump‚Äôs   cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New Year‚Äôs wishes ‚Äúto all,‚Äù including ‚Äúthose who have fought me and lost so badly they just don‚Äôt know what to do. ‚Äù) Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved  ‚Äî   the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the  . Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been given a golden opportunity here,‚Äù said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. ‚ÄúBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. ‚ÄúIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,‚Äù Mr. Lott continued. ‚ÄúYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ‚Äù The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump‚Äôs chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats  ‚Äî   including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York  ‚Äî   are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump‚Äôs agenda. ‚ÄúAfter campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   Trump‚Äôs postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he‚Äôs sworn in,‚Äù said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. ‚ÄúDemocrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ‚Äù Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. ‚ÄúI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,‚Äù the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. ‚ÄúI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ‚Äù In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules‚Äô completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year  ‚Äî   already a quarter over  ‚Äî   that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama‚Äôs, and they may delay the repeal measure‚Äôs effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump‚Äôs cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump‚Äôs nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. ‚ÄúThe senator doesn‚Äôt want to rush,‚Äù said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell‚Äôs refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats  ‚Äî   and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him  ‚Äî   want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party‚Äôs leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. ‚ÄúThis is no time for hubris,‚Äù Mr. McConnell said. ‚ÄúYou have to perform. ‚Äù



| 25 | 17311 | Republicans Stonewalled Obama. Now the Ball Is in Their Court. - The New York Times            | New York Times | Carl Hulse                     | 1/3/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | WASHINGTON  ‚Äî   It‚Äôs   or   time for Republicans. After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party, Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House, Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006. That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success. But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation‚Äôs health care delivery system, restructure the tax code, drive job creation, muscle up American foreign policy, rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course. Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way, constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth. Now they must show they can deliver. And they know it. ‚ÄúWhen you have both houses and the presidency, there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation,‚Äù said Representative Tom Cole, a senior Republican from Oklahoma. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly. ‚Äù That will not be easy. There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and   Donald J. Trump, leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide. Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress. Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate, in a climate that is, in many respects, even more hostile than it was before the November elections. Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama, including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court. Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland‚Äôs nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government. While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations, they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation  ‚Äî   at least for now. Perhaps most important, Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment. The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government. Nearly   of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch. As a result, Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now, if they can assemble the votes, their ideas will become law  ‚Äî   with all the attendant consequences. Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit, approve annual budgets, endorse spending bills and back other   measures that they formerly left to the Democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues. With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by Republicans, the Republicans who belonged to the ‚Äúvote no, hope yes‚Äù caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well. This isn‚Äôt the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 elections, and in the Senate in 2014, this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled, not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents. Eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that Republicans must now lead rather than ridicule. Tensions could arise between House and Senate Republicans as well. When the Newt   party took over the House in 1995 for the first time in four decades, newly empowered Republicans sent a raft of legislation to the Senate, only to see it stall there. With President Bill Clinton in the White House at the time, Republicans knew much of it would not be enacted. Now, with Mr. Trump soon to occupy the Oval Office, it is unlikely that House Republicans will be willing to watch Democrats bottle up legislation in the Senate. Demands that their Senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly. While they understand the challenges, Republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position. ‚ÄúA Republican in the White House and a Republican majority in Congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress,‚Äù Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, said in the party‚Äôs weekly radio address on Saturday. ‚ÄúWe assume that responsibility with the promise that we‚Äôll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to Americans tomorrow than they have today. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI am pretty giddy,‚Äù said Mr. Cole as he looked ahead. Republicans have won their chance. Now it is time to see what they can do with it.

Setting speed limits had been the states‚Äô responsibility. But in 1973, OPEC cut oil shipments to the United States for supporting Israel in a war with its Arab neighbors. The embargo hit the American economy hard. In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, lowering the speed limit to reduce consumption. And American car buyers sought out more   vehicles, turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan. The debate over road safety and speed limits continued for decades, and in 1995, President Bill Clinton repealed the federal limit, returning the power to the states. In parts of Texas, drivers can legally go 85 m. p. h. That‚Äôs the fastest in the country, though it‚Äôs slower than a few places in the world.

| 27 | 17313 | Inside Trump Defense Secretary Pick‚Äôs Efforts to Halt Torture - The New York Times           | New York Times | Sheri Fink and Helene Cooper   | 1/5/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003, outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines. The    man had been beaten, deprived of sleep, forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces. James N. Mattis,   Donald J. Trump‚Äôs nominee for secretary of defense, was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center. He quickly convened an inquiry into the death, which led to   and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison. ‚ÄúGeneral Mattis was all up in arms over this,‚Äù Ralph Dengler, then a lieutenant colonel, testified at a military hearing in January 2004. He added that the commander, who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart, had immediately described the death as ‚Äúthe worst thing that happened‚Äù under his watch in the Iraq war. ‚ÄúI was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it, considering many of the other deaths, including American deaths,‚Äù Colonel Dengler said. Colleagues say the general‚Äôs handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment, which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief. Mr. Trump, in a New York Times interview in late November, said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country‚Äôs 2. 2 million service members did not believe in torture. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump advocated bringing back the   practice of waterboarding, adding that ‚Äúonly a stupid person would say it doesn‚Äôt work. ‚Äù General Mattis does not support abusive techniques, let alone waterboarding. ‚ÄúGive me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers,‚Äù he told Mr. Trump during their meeting in November, according to the   ‚Äúand I do better with that than I do with torture. ‚Äù The general‚Äôs beliefs were shaped by his military training, but also by his experiences in dealing with issues related to torture or mistreatment, according to an examination of his nearly   career and interviews with former colleagues and friends. General Mattis led the United States Central Command from August 2010 to March 2013. Lt. Col. T. G. Taylor, who was General Mattis‚Äôs spokesman during much of that time, said in an interview that the commander had spoken of America as needing to hold the moral high ground. Failing to uphold important principles ‚Äúmakes it easier for a soldier or a Marine to ask, ‚ÄòWhat am I fighting for? ‚Äô‚Äù Colonel Taylor said. ‚ÄúThat is something that General Mattis is keenly aware of,‚Äù he added. As a young officer, General Mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions, which, among other protections, require humane treatment of prisoners of war. A Marine who enlisted in 1969 while attending college  ‚Äî   part of an R. O. T. C. program during the height of the Vietnam War  ‚Äî   he did not deploy to Vietnam. But, several friends say, he believed that American prisoners of war were more likely to be tortured by the Vietcong if the United States tortured enemy captives. In 2006, General Mattis supported Gen. David H. Petraeus of the Army and other military leaders in the development of a new counterinsurgency field manual that highlighted limits on interrogation tactics. ‚ÄúTorture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is never a morally permissible option, even if lives depend on gaining information,‚Äù the manual said. ‚ÄúLose moral legitimacy, lose the war. ‚Äù General Mattis later agreed in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that it was inappropriate for the military to support the use of abusive techniques on detainees  ‚Äî   including waterboarding, forced nudity and sensory deprivation, tactics inflicted on prisoners during interrogations in secret C. I. A. prisons in the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Those techniques had been modeled on a military training program operated by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, which later fell under the general‚Äôs command. That program, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape, also known as SERE, exposed United States soldiers and other service members to techniques that an enemy violating the laws of war might use so that Americans could be better prepared to resist them. The experience typically led trainees to conclude that tortured prisoners of war will say whatever they need to in order to stay alive, whether true or not. A recent investigation by The New York Times found that many terrorism suspects subjected to harsh tactics in C. I. A. jails or American military prisons had lasting mental health problems that were similar to those experienced by some American former P. O. W.s who suffered horrific abuses in Vietnam or Korea. As a commander in Afghanistan and later in Iraq, and as an overall leader of the American war effort, General Mattis often grappled with the consequences of the C. I. A. ‚Äôs treatment of prisoners and the harsh conditions at the military detention center at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. They became a powerful recruiting tool for jihadis who threatened American forces in the field. Testifying at a Senate hearing in 2015 after his retirement, General Mattis opposed the release, before the end of hostilities, of prisoners who had fought against the United States. However, he added, they should be treated humanely, in accordance with international and domestic law. ‚ÄúI would go by the Geneva Conventions, and maintain them, with Red Cross oversight, until the war is over,‚Äù he told lawmakers. Torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence, the general felt. ‚ÄúFor his whole career, he‚Äôs believed that it just doesn‚Äôt pay dividends,‚Äù said a retired senior United States military officer who is close to General Mattis but spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Trump. The ‚Äúpack of cigarettes‚Äù reference, according to people who served with the general, reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders: that information gleaned from torture is unreliable, and that   can go a long way. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in his head, but what General Mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture,‚Äù Colonel Taylor said. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump‚Äôs transition team, declined requests for more detail on the  ‚Äôs discussions with General Mattis or on the source of General Mattis‚Äôs beliefs and any further thoughts Mr. Trump has had about the use of torture. General Mattis declined to be interviewed. Many American military leaders maintain that the Bush administration‚Äôs departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques  ‚Äî   government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture, and had declared that detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions  ‚Äî   tainted the United States‚Äô reputation while not yielding results. ‚ÄúIneffective, war crime, against our values, moral high ground, et cetera,‚Äù Donald J. Guter, a retired rear admiral and the dean of the South Texas College of Law, said in explaining objections to brutal treatment. ‚ÄúA very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured, and we have no basis to object. If we torture, we‚Äôve lost who we are. ‚Äù The Department of Defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees. For example, the Army field manual‚Äôs section on intelligence collection states: ‚ÄúUse of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results. ‚Äù The manual adds, ‚ÄúCruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited. ‚Äù As a commander in Iraq, General Mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse. One of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned Iraqi Army barracks in southern Iraq, christened Camp Whitehorse. Prisoners were held by United States Marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty, stone building that had been looted of all amenities by Iraqis during the   invasion. The prisoner who died, Nagem Sadoon Hatab, had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch, a    private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an   rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to     treatment  ‚Äî   forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour, for up to 10 hours. The objective was to make the detainees tired, stressed and submissive for interrogators, witnesses later said in military court hearings. Like other prisoners at the center, Mr. Hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties. He was beaten severely by Marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and  . He also underwent questioning by a special Marine interrogation squad. A Marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling, screaming and banging from the interrogation room, a converted bathroom. After midnight on June 6, 2003, Mr. Hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours, his body covered in his own feces. An armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide. Mr. Hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck, the examiner concluded. Eight Camp Whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes, including negligent homicide. But the investigator appointed by General Mattis, Col. William B. Gallo, later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on Mr. Hatab, if any, might have been lethal. In Colonel Gallo‚Äôs opinion, the   treatment did not amount to torture, but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war. Evidence, including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent, had been lost or destroyed, complicating the investigation and prosecution. Two Marines, a major and a sergeant, were eventually convicted of lesser charges. Mr. Hatab‚Äôs death clearly had an effect on General Mattis. According to reports at the time, he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners, which resulted in a ban of   tactics, including the forced standing. Marine Corps personnel running detention camps were given more training, and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process. Still, there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division. Later, aiming to earn the trust of the Iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended, General Mattis added an addendum to the motto of his Marines: ‚ÄúNo better friend, no worse enemy. ‚Äù The addition was, ‚ÄúFirst, do no harm. ‚Äù

| 28 | 17314 | ISIS Claims Responsibility for Istanbul Nightclub Attack - The New York Times                  | New York Times | Tim Arango                     | 1/3/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | ISTANBUL  ‚Äî   The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New Year‚Äôs Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people, describing the gunman who carried out the assault  ‚Äî   and who has not been identified or captured  ‚Äî   as ‚Äúa hero soldier of the caliphate. ‚Äù The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman, who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a   rifle, but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack. The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman, captured by security cameras, that showed a   cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat. The government‚Äôs spokesman, Numan Kurtulmus, said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailant‚Äôs fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him. Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically, but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism. Referring to the attack, which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning, Mr. Kurtulmus said: ‚ÄúThe fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message. The message is, ‚ÄòWe will go on to menace Turkey in 2017.‚Äô And we say to them, we will break into your caves wherever you are. ‚Äù The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan, as saying, ‚ÄúAccording to preliminary information, this information is doubtful, but we are checking all the same. ‚Äù The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out ‚Äúin continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey, the protector of the cross. ‚Äù ‚ÄúA hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs, where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday,‚Äù read the statement from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. ‚ÄúThey used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning. ‚Äù In an apparent reference to Turkey‚Äôs role in the conflict in Syria, the statement warned that ‚Äúthe government of Turkey should know that the blood of Muslims, which it is targeting with its planes and its guns, will cause a fire in its home by God‚Äôs will. ‚Äù The statement did not name the assailant, and it was not clear whether the Islamic State had organized the attack or had merely inspired the gunman. But the shooting came just days after a   State group, the Nashir Media Foundation, published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs, markets and movie theaters. The Islamic State‚Äôs claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the Turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border. Several terrorist attacks in Turkey over the last year have been attributed to the Islamic State, but the militant group rarely claims responsibility for major attacks in the country. A rare exception came in November, when the group claimed to be behind a deadly car bombing in southeastern Turkey. Analysts said that the Islamic State has walked a fine line in Turkey, trying to balance its goal of destabilizing the country without antagonizing the government to the extent that it would crack down heavily. For years, Turkey looked the other way, according to analysts and regional diplomats, as jihadist groups moved fighters and supplies across the border, establishing deep networks in Turkish border towns. Committed to supporting the uprising against President Bashar   of Syria, Turkey felt the jihadists could be managed while they fought with forces loyal to the Syrian government. But that policy ultimately changed, as Turkey worked to secure its borders, under pressure from its allies as it took in millions of Syrian refugees and as terrorist attacks rocked the country. Turkey began a military intervention in northern Syria in August that put its forces on the front lines against Kurdish militants as well as Islamic State fighters. This turned the jihadists decidedly against Turkey, prompting their leaders to call for attacks there. The Turkish military said on Monday that it had struck Islamic State targets in Syria, killing at least 22 militants. American intelligence officials had recently expressed concern about a possible attack in Turkey, warning in a statement on Dec. 22 that extremist groups were ‚Äúcontinuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks throughout Turkey‚Äù in areas where American citizens and expatriates lived or visited. That warning came three days after a gunman, described by Turkish officials as a      police officer, assassinated Andrey G. Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, at an art gallery in the capital, Ankara. The gunman shouted ‚ÄúGod is great!‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget Aleppo, don‚Äôt forget Syria!‚Äù during the attack, which was captured on video. The   Anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack on Sunday had been identified, The Associated Press reported. At least two dozen of the people killed were said to be foreigners.

| 29 | 17317 | The Afghan War and the Evolution of Obama - The New York Times                                 | New York Times | Mark Landler                   | 1/17/17  | 2017  | 1   |         | WASHINGTON  ‚Äî   President Obama‚Äôs advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama‚Äôs longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened, the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year, when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council, he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. ‚ÄúThe fever in this room has finally broken,‚Äù the president told the group, according to a person in the meeting. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer in   mode. ‚Äù What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day, himself included, thought that the United States  ‚Äî   after 14 years of war, billions of dollars spent and more than 2, 000 American lives lost  ‚Äî   would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time, he added, ‚Äúthe counterterrorism challenges are real. ‚Äù As bleak as Afghanistan‚Äôs prospects were, the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. A few weeks later, the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan  ‚Äî   the ‚Äúgood war‚Äù to George W. Bush‚Äôs ‚Äúbad war‚Äù in Iraq  ‚Äî   had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a forever war. He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy,‚Äù the president said in an interview in September. Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump, a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts, Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed, as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, ‚Äúthat war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly. ‚Äù More than any other conflict, Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obama‚Äôs thinking on the basic questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people, we have to understand,‚Äù he said in the interview, ‚Äúthat this is a long slog. ‚Äù Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a ‚Äúdumb war. ‚Äù But in the same speech he also said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt oppose all wars. ‚Äù He was referring to Afghanistan, which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ‚ÄúI would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again,‚Äù he told the crowd that day in Chicago‚Äôs Federal Plaza. By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq  ‚Äî   the ‚Äúgood war,‚Äù in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration‚Äôs troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. ‚ÄúThis is a war that we have to win,‚Äù he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10, 000 soldiers, to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50, 000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer, the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle, nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country ‚Äúprecarious and urgent. ‚Äù More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008, a larger number than in any other prior year. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst, Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed, he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to nearly 70, 000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009, with the Taliban showing increased strength, Mr. Obama‚Äôs military commanders, backed by the elders on his war council, including Hillary Clinton, then his secretary of state, were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq  ‚Äî   a     expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, bridges, schools and a   government. The strategy, known by its acronym COIN, would require as many as 40, 000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, his advisers told him. ‚ÄúThere was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq, and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war,‚Äù said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan, and to assert what would be his worldview. ‚Äù ‚ÄúIn many ways, I think, he deferred,‚Äù said Mr. Nasr, now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he placed a strict timetable on the mission, saying they would have to be withdrawn again, starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice. Even some former military commanders agreed, saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number  ‚Äî   20, 000, for example  ‚Äî   look like a path to certain defeat. ‚ÄúPresident Obama was asking the military for broad options,‚Äù said Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obama‚Äôs ambassador to Kabul. But, he said, the military gave Mr. Obama only ‚Äúvariations‚Äù on ‚Äúthe more robust counterinsurgency model. ‚Äù Mr. Eikenberry, who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge, diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? ‚ÄúWhen he came in, everyone knew we were going to do more,‚Äù Mr. Eikenberry said. ‚ÄúBut what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define. ‚Äù Given Mr. Obama‚Äôs innate wariness of   it didn‚Äôt take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge, in the spring of 2010, David H. Petraeus, the commander of the Pentagon‚Äôs Central Command and an architect of the strategy, was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago, General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while, then cut him off. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar,‚Äù he curtly told General Petraeus, according to people in the room. ‚ÄúObama believes the military can do enormous things,‚Äù said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. ‚ÄúIt can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military can‚Äôt create a political culture or build a society. ‚Äù By the end of his first term, Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept ‚ÄúAfghan good enough. ‚Äù The phrase, which had been kicked around the White House since 2010, referred to the shift away from   to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists, preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard, things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010, 100, 000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign, Ryan Crocker, a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011, recalled thinking, ‚ÄúWow, this place looks great!‚Äù The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. Obama‚Äôs conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1, 2012, Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014, when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over Afghanistan‚Äôs security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons, but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an ‚Äúenduring partnership‚Äù between the United States and Afghanistan, with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops, and he was looking beyond the war. Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base, he suggested that America‚Äôs experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. ‚ÄúOne year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe goal I set  ‚Äî   to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild  ‚Äî   is now within our reach. ‚Äù Earlier, Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship  ‚Äî   on an earlier trip, Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government  ‚Äî   and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was ‚Äúvery aloof, almost cold, which bothered me a bit because I‚Äôd worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us. ‚Äù Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a   security agreement with Washington, Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president, his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner, it was impossible for the United States to succeed, no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries, from Pakistan to Israel, where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. ‚ÄúThe most underappreciated part of foreign policy,‚Äù Mr. Rhodes said, ‚Äúis dealing with flawed partners. ‚Äù When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015, the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse, there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown, under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. ‚ÄúThe mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited,‚Äù said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq, Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. ‚ÄúISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan,‚Äù Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama, he said, was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis, Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The   Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban, and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. Obama‚Äôs war council met that August morning, the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009, argued that the country would revert to chaos, regardless of how long the United States stayed there. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now,‚Äù he declared, according to those in the room. He was, he conceded, a ‚Äúbroken record‚Äù on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul, and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10, 000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular, ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative, General Dempsey told Mr. Obama, was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend ‚Äúwell beyond your presidency,‚Äù according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line, he said, with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N. Y. where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the   fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. ‚ÄúThis goes to the politics of what I‚Äôm leaving for the next president,‚Äù he told the group, according to one of the participants. ‚ÄúMy interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X,‚Äù he added, referring to troop numbers, ‚Äúbut to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision. ‚Äù Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September, he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had, after all, reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10, 000 from more than 100, 000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops, even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. The country had been broken to begin with, he said, and America was never going to fix it. ‚ÄúAfghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be,‚Äù Mr. Obama said. The country ‚Äúwas riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. It‚Äôs still there. ‚Äù In the end, Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare  ‚Äî   a chronic conflict, across an arc of unstable states, in which the United States is a participant, if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July, Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting, and a war being officially over,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world,‚Äù he went on, ‚ÄúI spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I‚Äôm not satisfied we‚Äôve got it perfect yet. ‚Äù

| 30 | 17318 | Tips for Your Post-Holiday Clutter Purge - The New York Times                                  | New York Times | Michelle Higgins               | 4/11/17  | 2017  | 4   |         | With the year winding down and New Year‚Äôs resolutions just around the corner, it‚Äôs time to gear up for that   clutter purge. But the thought of tackling the kitchen junk drawer  ‚Äî   or even taking down the decorations  ‚Äî   can be overwhelming. So to help motivate you, several organizing professionals offered tips on how to streamline your closets, beat back the toys taking over the living room and, yes, finally deal with that junk drawer. START WITH THE HOLIDAY TRAPPINGS To keep plastic ornaments and Hanukkah candles organized, use small containers you already have on hand, like popcorn and cookie tins or empty shoeboxes and egg cartons. Wrap fragile ornaments in leftover tissue paper or newspaper, or invest in storage containers like archival ornament boxes from the Container Store. For strings of lights and garlands, use zip ties to avoid tangles and put them in plastic bags labeled according to use (tree lights, porch lights, balcony, bushes, etc. ). Zip ties can also be used on wreaths, so that they can be hung on coat hangers and covered with plastic garment bags from the dry cleaner. To avoid a stockpile of holiday cards, ‚Äúsave only those that are meaningful and special,‚Äù Tova Weinstock, a professional organizer in Brooklyn, said. ‚ÄúFor the others, appreciate them as you receive them and then kindly send them to the trash. ‚Äù EDIT YOUR CLOSET Eliminating clothes you never wear is easier said than done. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in ‚ÄòIf you haven‚Äôt used or worn something in a year, get rid of it,‚Äô‚Äù said Laura Cattano, another organizer in Brooklyn. ‚ÄúHow you want to live moving forward is a much better guide for editing than whether or not you actually have used something in the past. ‚Äù Focus on the image you would like to project, she said, then start at one end of the closet and review each piece, pulling out those you know you can toss, donate or sell. Try on anything you haven‚Äôt worn in a while and consider how it makes you feel or if it could be styled differently. Clothes you have forgotten about could be ‚Äúyour new favorite thing,‚Äù she said, while there may be some pieces you wear all the time that should be retired. (If you subscribe to the Marie Kondo method of decluttering, ask yourself, ‚ÄúDoes it ‚Äòspark joy? ‚Äô‚Äù) Sort clothes by type, grouping pants together, then shirts or blouses, jackets or dresses. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt see it, you won‚Äôt wear it,‚Äù said Sharon Lowenheim, an organizer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the founder of the Organizing Goddess. ‚ÄúSo remove dry cleaning bags and hang only one item per hanger. ‚Äù Arranging shirts by sleeve length, with the shortest at the front, makes them easier to find, said Ms. Lowenheim, who also subscribes to a rotation method: selecting garments to wear from the front of each section, then hanging them up toward the back after they are cleaned. ‚ÄúIf you find yourself continually bypassing an item at the front, that is a signal to you that you just don‚Äôt like that item,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGet rid of it. ‚Äù Another way to keep your closet streamlined is to store   clothes out of sight, said Faith Roberson, an organizer in Manhattan and the founder of Organize With Faith. When clothes have been put away for half the year and you‚Äôve done fine without them, ‚Äúit changes your perspective,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou can honestly ask yourself, ‚ÄòDo I actually love this piece? And if I don‚Äôt, why am I holding onto it? ‚Äô‚Äù TACKLE THE TOYS Organizing pros agree that the best way to keep toys from taking over is to get children involved in selecting some to donate. ‚ÄúFinding a charity that provides toys to less fortunate children is very motivating for a child,‚Äù said Ms. Lowenheim, whose    daughter purged her playthings in this manner before each birthday and holiday, starting when she was a toddler. Before that, Ms. Lowenheim said, she would sneak into her daughter‚Äôs room while she was sleeping to gather up the games and stuffed animals she was no longer playing with. ‚ÄúWhen she was around 3, she started noticing if something was missing and would ask me about it,‚Äù Ms. Lowenheim said. ‚ÄúAt that point, I realized that I had to involve her in the process. ‚Äù If they cooperate, be sure to respect their decision, Ms. Roberson said, even if they choose something you wouldn‚Äôt have. ‚ÄúParents think about the money they‚Äôve spent,‚Äù she said, or the sentimental value, which can make them reluctant to let go of that American Girl doll or the train set from Aunt Joan. Another strategy is to encourage them to sell the toys they no longer play with, either online or at a garage sale, and keep the proceeds for themselves. Once the toys have been pared down, Ms. Roberson swears by clear shoe or sweater drawers for storage. ‚ÄúThey are stackable, they have dividers, are easy to clean, easy to label, and they come in four different sizes,‚Äù she said. To help maintain order, ‚Äúlabel where each toy goes,‚Äù said Ms. Lowenheim, who recommends installing a tall bookcase and putting paints, jigsaw puzzles and other games that tend to leave a mess on the highest shelf. If your child is too young to read, label the containers with stickers or pictures. If everything has ‚Äúa home‚Äù to return to at the end of the day, she said, cleanup will be easier. AND THAT JUNK DRAWER . .. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste your time standing over the drawer sifting through it piece by piece,‚Äù Ms. Roberson said. Dump everything onto the floor or countertop, divide it into piles and then ask yourself: Do I want it? Does it work? Does it need to be in the junk drawer? If not, where else could it go? ‚ÄúTake it easy, and go pile by pile,‚Äù she said. Put things where they belong (like that miniature tube of toothpaste you got from the dentist that should go in your toiletries bag) and discard things you don‚Äôt need, like old keys and expired batteries and coupons. To ward off atrophy, buy a drawer organizer, suggested Ms. Lowenheim, who uses expandable drawer organizers from Staples in her own home. ‚ÄúThe key thing is to measure the drawer, then find the organizer that best fits the space,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs too small, it won‚Äôt help. ‚Äù The reward? ‚ÄúKeeping everything sorted by type,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwill make it easier for you to find something when you need it. ‚Äù

| 31 | 17319 | Benjamin Netanyahu Questioned in Israel Graft Inquiry - The New York Times                     | New York Times | Isabel Kershner                | 1/3/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | JERUSALEM  ‚Äî   Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned ‚Äúunder caution,‚Äù the police said in a statement, implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense. ‚ÄúNo further details can be given at this stage,‚Äù the statement added. The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433, a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit, with the authorization of the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit. In a detailed statement, the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses, some abroad, and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry. While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes, the statement said, other parts warranted a deeper investigation. Mr. Netanyahu, who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges, has vehemently denied any impropriety. ‚ÄúThis will all come to nothing, because there is nothing,‚Äù he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations. Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases, one more serious than the other, but they have offered little detail on the more serious one. The less weighty one, according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets, concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu, and possibly for members of his family, given by Israeli and foreign business executives. The Israeli police took testimony from Ronald S. Lauder, a conservative American businessman and philanthropist, and a close friend of Mr. Netanyahu‚Äôs, when he came to Israel in late September to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and president. Upon Mr. Lauder‚Äôs arrival in Israel, he was asked to meet with the Israeli police ‚Äúand respond to questions related to an investigation, to which Mr. Lauder is not a party,‚Äù Helena Beilin, a Tel   lawyer representing Mr. Lauder, said in a statement. ‚ÄúAfter a short meeting the following day, he was told that his presence was no longer needed and that there would be no need for additional meetings. This remains the case. ‚Äù Mr. Netanyahu‚Äôs office, suggesting that he is the victim of a witch hunt, issued a statement over the weekend berating the news organizations for what it described as premature and politically motivated reports. ‚ÄúTry to replace the prime minister at the ballot boxes, as is accepted in democracies,‚Äù it added. In televised remarks on Monday afternoon, Mr. Netanyahu told legislators from his conservative Likud Party in Parliament, ‚ÄúWe hear the celebratory spirit and winds blowing through the television studios and in the corridors of the opposition. ‚Äù ‚ÄúHold off the celebrations don‚Äôt rush,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you before and will tell you again  ‚Äî   this will come to nothing, because there is nothing. ‚Äù Mr. Netanyahu is serving his third consecutive term in office, and his fourth over all. He has exuded confidence lately, lashing out at journalists who have been critical of him, talking up Israel‚Äôs diplomatic and economic achievements, and calling in the United States ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a dressing down late last month after the Obama administration decided not to use its veto to shield Israel from a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu, generally a popular prime minister, has developed a combative relationship with the local mainstream news media. After years of tension with the Obama administration, he also appears buoyed by the prospect of a partnership with   Donald J. Trump, who seems more sympathetic to Israeli government policies on issues like settlements. For Mr. Netanyahu‚Äôs opponents, the prospect of a possible indictment has provided a glimmer of hope, even though elections are not scheduled until late 2019. ‚ÄúThis creates an unusual dynamic in Israeli politics,‚Äù said Nahum Barnea, a political columnist for the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and a critic of Mr. Netanyahu. On the one hand, Mr. Barnea said, there were already signs that Netanyahu loyalists would try to promote legislation banning investigations of sitting prime ministers. On the other, he said, the question of who might succeed Mr. Netanyahu, who has no natural heir in his party, was bound to be raised. Opposition leaders were fairly subdued in their initial response. Isaac Herzog, the leader of the Zionist Union and of the opposition in Parliament, said it was ‚Äúa tough day for Israel when a prime minister is under investigation. ‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWe are not expressing satisfaction at another‚Äôs misfortune. ‚Äù Mr. Herzog has also been the subject of police investigations over campaign funding. Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, which has challenged Likud in recent polls, said, ‚ÄúThe presumption of innocence applies to every Israeli, including the prime minister. ‚Äù He called for a swift investigation for the sake of the country, saying, ‚ÄúA person who is being investigated is a person under pressure. ‚Äù Israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation, unless they are charged with a crime. Nonetheless, the accusations could chip away at Mr. Netanyahu‚Äôs standing. His predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption, although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009. In February, Mr. Olmert became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison. He is serving a   term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Mr. Netanyahu described Mr. Olmert in 2008 as a ‚Äúprime minister up to his neck in investigations‚Äù and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests. Since the 1990s, Mr. Netanyahu‚Äôs political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct, and that of people around him, though no charges have been filed against him. The inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture  ‚Äî   the Netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime minister‚Äôs official residence with an identical, old set in their private home in Caesarea  ‚Äî   to a more recent one involving a   deal with Germany for the acquisition of submarines. That agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that Mr. Netanyahu‚Äôs personal lawyer also represents the Israeli agent of the German shipyard that builds the submarines, and other naval equipment purchased by Israel, giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest. In that episode, too, Mr. Netanyahu and the lawyer, David Shimron, have denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Netanyahu‚Äôs relationship with Arnaud Mimran, a French tycoon who was convicted of fraud last year, and who testified that he had contributed a large sum of money to Mr. Netanyahu for his 2009 election campaign, has also prompted suspicions of impropriety.

| 32 | 17321 | France Lets Workers Turn Off, Tune Out and Live Life - The New York Times                      | New York Times | Alissa J. Rubin                | 1/3/17   | 2017  | 1   |         | PARIS  ‚Äî   If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations, universal health care and fine food and wine, the arrival of 2017 brings this: a newly created ‚Äúright to disconnect. ‚Äù Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on   email after hours, it is not quite that. But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time, and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employer‚Äôs demands intrude on evenings at home, treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family. ‚ÄúEmployees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office,‚Äù Myriam El Khomri, the minister of labor, said last year in justifying the need for the law. ‚ÄúThe boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous,‚Äù and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent, she said. The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world. The new provision in the labor law does not ban   emails, but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or   hours. Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the ‚Äúreply all‚Äù function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond, rather than half the office. Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply  ‚Äî   several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p. m. and 7 a. m. others the 12 hours between 7 p. m. and 7 a. m. As a country with Catholic roots, but also a commitment to personal liberties, France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce. It has long been legal, but not necessarily speedy. A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce. While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy, it still required a judge to rule on each divorce. The procedure routinely took as long as a year, and sometimes far longer, because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature. Now, if both members of the couple agree on the divorce, lawyers can draw up the divorce agreement, jointly sign the papers and have them notarized. No judges need be involved. Smoking is another area in which French habits have changed relatively little in recent years  ‚Äî   27 to 28 percent of the population still lights up  ‚Äî   but the country is now following many others in requiring ‚Äúneutral packaging‚Äù for tobacco products: Instead of advertising a brand, cigarette packs sport only health warnings and photos of illnesses caused by smoking. At least two new laws demonstrate the country‚Äôs gradual move toward more sustainable products. Instead of thin plastic bags, French supermarkets and fruit vendors must substitute either bags made with a   synthetic called amidon that is mixed with plastic, a thicker type of plastic bag that could be reused, or paper bags. At Monoprix, a supermarket chain, paper bags have won out and stacks of them perch precariously on stands at the ends of fruit counters. More radical is the edict that went into effect on Sunday banning the use of pesticides in public gardens and along public highways. It promises to make public green spaces safer for birds and other small animals, which are especially vulnerable to the poisons used in pest killers. It will not be easy for the gardeners employed by cities to turn to more sustainable methods. When the city of Lyon abandoned pesticides voluntarily nine years ago, it took quite some time to change the culture, although Lyon is now considered a model. In 2019, the antipesticide law will expand to include amateur gardeners  ‚Äî   a challenge not only for the French with backyard rows of dahlias and daisies, but also for those who nurse roses in their window boxes. A new   law is sure to please the French because it plays to their immense pride in local comestibles: It allows prepared foods, like frozen dinners, to be labeled ‚Äúproduit d‚Äôorigine fran√ßaise‚Äù only if the item is made with 100 percent French meat or milk. Any product with more than 8 percent foreign meat must say where the animal was born, raised and butchered. A product with more than 50 percent foreign milk must say where it was collected and turned into the product being sold. It seems that the French version of ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù is ‚ÄúRaised in France. ‚Äù

Possible Roadblocks:
* Specificity in clusters. Russia = Russian election hacking or Russian international relations or Russian Olympic ban?
* Intersections in broad topics. E.g. "Donald Trump speaks about Hurricane Matthew" about DT or hurricane?


Notes:
* Put special emphasis on dates and names when organizing clusters (use spacy entity recognition)
